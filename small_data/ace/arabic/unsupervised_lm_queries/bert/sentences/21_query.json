witnessed after its recent elections to the one that was allocated to the former Czechoslovakia during what was known as the quotvelvet revolutionquot which took place immediately after the Soviet collapse nearly a decade ago calm peaceful and smooth until almost It is a festival or a festive occasion and the analogy that had at its moment the events justifications and this if not based on the foundations of reality it certainly stems from a psychological climate from that comfort that prevailed in public opinion whether external or internal and he sees the Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic falling apart Very easily since no one was expecting a Yugoslav A if her tradeoff is to get rid of her dictator like that scenario but another completely contrary such as that which Romania had previously been a theater for for example Milosevic from the clay of Nikolai Ceausescu and that system from the clay of this regime there is no way to eradicate it except through conspiracy and violence The last days since Milosevics overthrow may have been in the process of restoring things in that regard as we are in the end in the Balkans the region of fragmentation and schism and a culture of violence and folklore revenge not in central Europe that metallic Europe that has always been a region of cultural advancement I think we are in Serbia the country of national tension The stars were people like Karadzic and by the way he used to write poetry in addition to his criminal activity at the head of the Bosnian Serbs or General Ratko Mladic not in Czechoslovakia the country of Kafka and Kundera and that was the one who took over a playwright Vaclav Havel the presidency of the republic and so on if it was  Velvet revolution in her country from the nature of things there the calm characterized by the Yugoslav transformation seems suspicious precisely because of his extreme calmness because what if Milosevic had stepped down in what appeared to be recognition of his electoral defeat against his competitor Vojislav Kostunica just a trick or a maneuver by a known man How thirsty for th Plan and to keep them and the lack of public opinion and what bothered to think he can or wants This is a question whose legitimacy has become numerous in light of the developments of the past days based on a number of evidences that have been evident and intertwined Perhaps the most striking thing in that regard is the way in which the quotYugoslavquot transformation was carried out and it is true that the supporters of the new president had occupied the parliament building And the headquarters of the official television and some other facilities and that the latter has settled in the presidency but what can be observed is that Milosevic although still free retains the right to act in the political life of the country but he did not intercede his recognition of his defeat and the congratulations he addressed to his opponent as in Head country The old foot in democracy is a ritual of receiving and receiving that takes place formally as if it does not acknowledge the legitimacy of what happened but rather the matter of his stepping down does not appear to be the revolution that public opinion cheered led to the collapse of the previous regime a definite collapse but rather it seems to those who reflect on its stages It is a temporary solution that does not end the battle a solution that Russia was his sponsor or it may be the one who proposed it as it should not be forgotten that the first public appearance of Milosevic after the popular uprising that he was supposed to have claimed was after he received the Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov and that this The latter is the first to express the will of the former Serbian dictator before the latter Plus said it This and his will is represented by his being active in public affairs a political leader almost normal in the political life of the country As for the Russian role in that regard it may be understandable Moscow is concerned with what is going on in Yugoslavia on the basis of ethnic cultural and religious traditional rapprochement McCain and she may have been so keen and it has become impossible to continue to support Milosevics stay in power in directing the transformations in Yugoslavia so that it does not lead to the transition of that country completely and to a completed manner to the Western camp with what this may mean in the future of its involvement in NATO that is from the latter39s continued expansion East and this represents some of Russia39s greatest strategic concerns and nightmares which may have seen maintaining Milosevics role in the Yugoslav affairs as some ways to prevent him at least because the former Serbian dictator has a vital interest in the personal sense in preventing any full normalization between Belgrade and Western capitals in Europe and North America However these calculations if any can only be corrected if they are based on an actual force that Milosevic still possesses and this is what appears to be the reality Why did he give up the former tyrant precisely when he recognized his opponent39s victory From the position of the presidency of Yugoslavia ie from the federal presidency and this may not be the thing that reminds and does not confer broad powers if not in terms of constitutional texts in terms of the actual reality the said federation is no longer formed after the exit of Croatia Slovenia Bosnia Herzegovina etc except from the Republic Montenegro and this small weak which is moving in the way of secession and from the Republic of Serbia and this is the nerve of federalism and the center of its power is population weight and economic weight political power and military power so that whoever does not control Serbia has no chance to control the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and that is precisely that The state of the lung The new Kostunica who is still unable to form a government to run the affairs of the country replacing it with a temporary committee similar to the crisis cell has no legal legitimacy and no constitution As for the Republic of Serbia with its government parliament and institutions including repression and coercion it is still in the hands of Milosevic And his followers from the Serbian Socialist Party and its allied parties and this together represents a force to be reckoned with which it may be able in the future to abort the Yugoslav revolution especially since the quotSerbian Democratic Oppositionquot parties wrapped around the new president are less homogeneous count on the street and this may not be the content of The mobilization is always then it often seemed breathless behind civil society organizations to strive to catch up with them and this if they have the initiative but they may not necessarily master the right political behavior in all cases because if it is good sometimes to take politics to the street to resolve An authoritarian situation as well as that which existed in Yugoslavia its long stay in it may not have a safe order of consequences and it may fall back on those who came to its advantage and in any case the forces loyal to Milosevic or those who were loyal to him failed the efforts of the new president to form his government just as She rejected his proposal to hold elections A premature sponsor next December that will lead to a new majority that reflects the current political quorum and in that may turn into a trap for the new president who saw that the existing law and legislation adhere to become the heart of the verse and make followers of the former dictator more In the interest of respecting it and if we add to that that the army is still not clear of loyalty to the new president and that the police do not define positions and if some of its units join the popular uprising and support it it may be premature to say Goodbye Milosevic because the Yugoslav revolution is still imperfect facing it Difficulties a Much has been incurred until now and its salvation may only lie in dealing with Milosevic as required by the situation of a war criminal and a criminal in the right of humanity He must be removed from public life and submitted to trial but we are in the Balkans and not in the dead Europe\tThe decision to manually sort out all cards that were not counted by the

learned that investigators of the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI affiliated to the American Embassy in Cairo have started efforts to find information about the activities of Egyptian elements that were linked for a while to bin Laden and alZawahiri in Afghanistan and then they headed to Yemen and others still residing in Afghanistan turned out to have trained quotIslamic suicide bombersquot in preparing explosives and organizing suicide operations and the sources stated that among those who Americans seek to know about their history is the Egyptian chemical engineer Medhat Morsi who is known among the fundamentalists as quotAbu Khababquot who turned out to be from He went to the coastal province of Alexandria and got a Bachelor of Science from her university at the end of the seventies and he left Egypt in the eighties and toured several countries until he settled in Afghanistan where he worked as an expert in the field of explosives taking advantage of his academic experiences and cooperated with several fundamentalist organizations taken from Afghan lands throughout the eighties until the early nineties centers and sources added that Abu Khabab officially joined the midnineties to the quotAlQaedaquot organization founded by Osama bin Laden and quickly raised the organizational ladder as a result of his high efficiency in training the organization39s members until he became the third man in quotAlQaedaquot after Ibn Laden and his assistant Subaihi Abu Sitta known as Abu Hafs alMasri who is in command of the military action of the organization and the sources suggested that the perpetrators of the Aden operation were trained by Abu Khabab noting that the man undertook these tasks after the killing of the former military leader of alQaeda Ali alRashidi known as the father And Obaida AlTabashiri who died by drowning in an African lake in the midnineties and the sources confirmed that the initial indications of the investigations are heading towards not linking the bombing of the Cole and the explosion that took place at the British embassy in Sana39a on the second day as it was found that the embassy bombing was carried out in a primitive way from Throwing a bomb that caused it to fall on the electricity board inside the embassy added to the force of the detonation while the detonation of the destroyer was a carefully planned action according to a scheme similar to the bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998\tYesterday, the court session that examined the Palestinian appeal, Jawad Al-Butma and Samar Al-Alami, suspended the decision of their conviction for &quot;conspiring to cause&quot; two explosions at the Israeli embassy and &quot;Balfour House&quot; in London in July 1994, after their lawyer Michael Mansfield told the court that someone called the day before yesterday. One of the members of the defense team, lawyer Gareth Pearce, provided her with information that could shed light on the embassy bombing. Mansfield said that the person who called Pearce mentioned that the information was originally provided to the police, and it is assumed that he did so before the two bombings in 1994, and Pearce maintains the name of the person who transmitted the information to a center The police and the names of the police officers who were given them and Mansfield said that the defense team intends to provide this information in a letter to the Public Prosecution Authority to verify whether it is registered and asked Mansfield to give the defense team some time to follow up on this new information, as well as the information that was given to him the day before yesterday that the security apparatus The British MI5 had received a warning about the bombing and Mansfield wanted to also consult with George Jovi and Yazid Sayegh, who were represented as defense experts during the trial of al-Butma and Al-Alami in December 1996, and the Palestinians were sentenced to 20 years in prison after being convicted by a body Jurors, Judge Rose, who heads the three-judge court, announced that in light of what Mansfield said, the session should be suspended, but he warned that the trial may not be resumed until several months later because the three judges have other obligations and the consideration of the appeal in the Supreme Court began Tuesday. In the past, the police had said during the trial in 1996 that there was an &quot;intelligence vacuum&quot; in the case, while the judge announced at the end of the trial that a large number of questions remained unanswered, but the defense team believes that there is a large amount of intelligence that can show that a decision Condemn the Lamy and al-Butma are \u201cnot trusted\u201d and should be canceled by the Court of Appeal, but the defense faces, as the court sessions showed, significant obstacles that prevent it from obtaining any of this information. With the aim of helping the Palestinians in the occupied territories, and mentioning that a Palestinian named Reda Al-Mughrabi is still unknown, he \u201cfabricated\u201d against them the charge of conspiracy to carry out the bombing operations, and the prosecution questioned whether the Moroccan was indeed present, but the defense hopes that the new information will be consistent with the statements of al-Butmah and al-Alam Y during the trial regarding Al-Maghrabi&#39;s presence and activities in London, the defense team argues that the party that carried out the bombings was an organized group and perhaps related to the Iranian or Israeli government. Judges Mansfield was briefed the day before yesterday on a summary of some of the information that was previously classified showed that the MI5 And the &quot;special branch&quot; of the London Police obtained, before the bombing of the Israeli embassy, evidence from a &quot;client&quot; that a terrorist organization was seeking information about the embassy site in London and its protection arrangements, but such information was not provided to that terrorist organization and did not carry out the bombings. And she said to me SR after the suspension of the session yesterday: \u201cThey provided us with a small amount of information that does not provide any help at all.

late now and more than half of the blessed month has passed but with the abundance of what has been written about Ramadan affairs in this month of fasting there is still something that can be added and it is known that the first judge in Egypt went out with people to see the crescent Ramadan is the judge Ibn Lahiya AlMaqrizi the famous historian of Egypt narrated that he was in the Mokattam Mountain a deck which is a tall rectangular seat known as the bench of judges and they used to go out to observe the crescent and the Fatimids had special matters related to Ramadan including that in the three days preceding the holy month the judges were with them Those who take refuge in the Gate of the Caliph the Witnesses and the followers wander around all the nightmares D they lose their brushes and architecture and they work to remove the shag and dust in them so that they are usable in this month I do not intend to talk about Ramadan celebrations before not until now but I want to pass on to our esteemed readers what I knew about the Ramadan cannon to announce the time of suhoor and then Constipation from food and the time of breaking the fast when the fasting people are blessed with the blessings that God has bestowed on them of their livelihoods History tells us that the custom of firing the Ramadan cannon started in Egypt at the end of the Mamluk era that is before Muhammad Ali assumed the mandate of Egypt in the year 5081 one of these governors bought a European cannon and wanted To try it and launch attempts took a long time and This happened on one of the days of Ramadan and the vulva did not come and the cannon set off only when the day signaled the end and the muezzins went up to the minarets to call on the ears of Morocco Although the matter was just a coincidence people thought that the governor wanted to warn them that the time for breakfast had come and then The firing of the cannon is usually proven at the time of breakfast and suhur and the current breakfast cannon that is launched in Egypt goes back to the days of Muhammad Ali Pasha the ruler of Egypt from 5081 to 1948 The first cannon was made in Germany and inscribed on it quotKrupp 9quot and Krupp was one of the largest weapons factories in Europe for a period Long in the Egyptian archives records that this cannon He participated in military battles before and when it was time for him to retire stay in his current location near Salah ElDin Castle and a thousand people on that day to watch the governor and rulers wearing official quothonorablequot clothes and head to the castle for special celebrations to attend the sighting of the crescent and celebrate the month of fasting which he was announcing For the people of this cannon and its successors after it and as long as we refer to the month of Ramadan which Muslims around the world bless let us mention something about its special dishes in Egypt the most famous of which is the fava beans dish the tarshi dish and the pickled municipalities and there are nuts that are served after breakfast and the custom took place in the popular neighborhoods so that customers do not buy Fava beans or thrash only an hour before breakfast or a little more than that believing that the dishes are ready fresh and I have witnessed a crowd of this kind on AlMosky Street in Cairo on a visit to me more than half a century ago and what I remember about that visit are pictures published in a magazine quotThe photographerquot for breakfast hosted by quotIslam Pashaquot for a group of friends and tableware of beans topped the magazine The magazine insisted on the day saying that Islam Pasha sent his private car to Mansoura north of Cairo at a great distance because he was a famous fan so he wanted his guests to enjoy his beans and wanted It is to mention the press with care to delight him Loyal friends When I visited Cairo in the middle of the year 2000 it was not the time for Ramadan but the city with a population of 31 million at night and about 61 million in the day and enjoying the noise of cars and their horns are deafening I dont think people care about hearing the Ramadan cannon that is still fired From the castle every evening or until the muezzins voice was poor the Ramadan cannon made the noise lose its joy and became screaming in the wilderness\tAll Palestinian factions under the
