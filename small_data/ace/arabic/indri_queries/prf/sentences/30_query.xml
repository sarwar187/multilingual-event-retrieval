Sufyan in preparing the Maritime Contract Company Sarmolm to steal maritime equipment belonging to it and impede the implementation of a judicial decision in 1998 Yesterday the court session that examined the Palestinian appeal Jawad AlButma and Samar AlAlami suspended the decision of their conviction for quotconspiring to causequot two explosions at the Israeli embassy and quotBalfour Housequot in London in July 1994 after their lawyer Michael Mansfield told the court that someone called the day before yesterday One of the members of the defense team lawyer Gareth Pearce provided her with information that could shed light on the embassy bombing Mansfield said that the person who called Pearce mentioned that the information was originally provided to the police and it is assumed that he did so before the two bombings in 1994 and Pearce maintains the name of the person who transmitted the information to a center The police and the names of the police officers who were given them and Mansfield said that the defense team intends to provide this information in a letter to the Public Prosecution Authority to verify whether it is registered and asked Mansfield to give the defense team some time to follow up on this new information as well as the information that was given to him the day before yesterday that the security apparatus The British MI5 had received a

canceled by the Court of Appeal but the defense faces as the court sessions showed significant obstacles that prevent it from obtaining any of this information With the aim of helping the Palestinians in the occupied territories and mentioning that a Palestinian named Reda AlMughrabi is still unknown he fabricated against them the charge of conspiracy to carry out the bombing operations and the prosecution questioned whether the Moroccan was indeed present but the defense hopes that the new information will be consistent with the statements of alButmah and alAlam Y during the trial regarding AlMaghrabi39s presence and activities in London the defense team argues that the party that carried out the bombings was an organized group and perhaps related to the Iranian or Israeli government

substantial amendments to the economic policies of the country in order to reduce negative effects and enrich the positive repercussions The study prepared by Dr Asim Arab Center for Economic and Administrative Studies and including his monthly economic report stated that the most important final positive factors The potential repercussions arising from joining the organization are economic

research in the fields of quality internal and external marketing and benefit from internal and external savings for largescale production and to create an appropriate investment climate to increase the effectiveness of the role of the private sector and attract foreign investment and implementation A successful and effective allocation program and the ability of the national economy to adapt to the changes and developments The study expected that these considerations will lead to quotthe adaptation of economic policiesquot in the next stage of the development process for Saudi Arabia within the framework of the Seventh Development Plan 2000 2005 and to amend and develop the financial monetary commercial and labor market policies in The main sectors of the Saudi economy The study stated in a quick review of the economic sectors in Saudi Arabia that nontariff restrictions on agricultural imports to Saudi Arabia are not present at all and that the maximum tariff on imports is a button It does not exceed 12 percent and it is less than its counterpart in the framework of joining the organization quotTherefore this does not lead to negative repercussions but there are capabilities to benefit from the positive repercussions for the Saudi food industriesquot As for the issue of reducing or eliminating agricultural subsidies The volume of subsidies and benefits granted by the government to the agricultural sector is equivalent to 45 percent of the value of the products Despite the high percentage it is less than its counterparts in the European Community Sweden and Japan and this support is expected to be phased out gradually during a period ranging between 6 and 9 years after the accession Saudi Arabia to m Trade regulations and this may lead to higher prices of agricultural and food products quotIt is expected according to the study that the Saudi consumer of limited income will be exposed to some inflationary effects resulting from his consumption of some basic commodities such as wheat meat and sugar while dairy producers may benefit from higher prices On the basis of their competitive ability at various local regional and international levels it is indicated that Saudi Arabia is still negotiating to join the organization and is considered the only Gulf country that has not yet joined it So how did she agree to close the station except in return

Russia39s return to cooperation And the military with Tehran this issue was discussed in Brooks for the past week at the level of defense ministers of two countries and it is natural that it raises

candidate Al Gore and his Republican rival George W Bush are preparing a summary of their case for presentation in the American Supreme Court session tomorrow paving the way for the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak the way for the prime ministerial elections during Sixty days and mixed reactions to Mr Baraks resignation Clashes between Israelis and Palestinians over the night resulted in the killing of a Palestinian and the isolated Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif arriving in the Syrian Arab Republic after his release and amnesty In Pakistan the United Nations Mission in Georgia said that military observers were kidnapped in the breakaway region of Abkhazia Israel in the absence of its resigning president Ehud Barak and the conditions of the world39s children in a new report issued by UNICEF In new provocative statements to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak he claimed that French President Jacques Chirac encouraged a return to terrorist acts by supporting the position of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat during the talks that took place in Paris yesterday and after Barak39s statement is the first that he issues directly although many Israeli officials have They echoed such allegations that the French President had taken during the talks a clear stance in which he rebuked Barak and accused him of colluding with the terrorist Ariel Sharon and supported the Palestinian position to form an international commission of inquiry into the Israeli massacres against the unarmed civilians from the Palestinians Liras follow after the fourth and twenty news we have after the break the ousted Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic admits defeat and congratulate Kostunica by winning the post of President of Yugoslavia as well as the death and injury of two dozen people in a series of explosions in southern Russia Some rushed to liken the transformation that Yugoslavia witnessed after its recent elections to the one that was allocated to the former Czechoslovakia during what was known as the quotvelvet revolutionquot which took place immediately after the Soviet collapse nearly a decade ago calm peaceful and smooth until almost It is a festival or a festive occasion and the analogy that had at its moment the events justifications and this if not based on the foundations of reality it certainly stems from a psychological climate from that comfort that prevailed in public opinion whether external or internal and he sees the Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic falling apart Very easily since no one was expecting a Yugoslav A if her tradeoff is to get rid of her dictator like that scenario but another completely contrary such as that which Romania had previously been a theater for for example Milosevic from the clay of Nikolai Ceausescu and that system from the clay of this regime there is no way to eradicate it except through conspiracy and violence The last days since Milosevics overthrow may have been in the process of restoring things in that regard as we are in the end in the Balkans the region of fragmentation and schism and a culture of violence and folklore revenge not in central Europe that metallic Europe that has always been a region of cultural advancement I think we are in Serbia the country of national tension The stars were people like Karadzic and by the way he used to write poetry in addition to his criminal activity at the head of the Bosnian Serbs or General Ratko Mladic not in Czechoslovakia the country of Kafka and Kundera and that was the one who took over a playwright Vaclav Havel the presidency of the republic and so on if it was  Velvet revolution in her country from the nature of things there the calm characterized by the Yugoslav transformation seems suspicious precisely because of his extreme calmness because what if Milosevic had stepped down in what appeared to be recognition of his electoral defeat against his competitor Vojislav Kostunica just a trick or a maneuver by a known man How thirsty for th Plan and to keep them and the lack of public opinion and what bothered to think he can or wants This is a question whose legitimacy has become numerous in light of the developments of the past days based on a number of evidences that have been evident and intertwined Perhaps the most striking thing in that regard is the way in which the quotYugoslavquot transformation was carried out and it is true that the supporters of the new president had occupied the parliament building And the headquarters of the official television and some other facilities and that the latter has settled in the presidency but what can be observed is that Milosevic although still free retains the right to act in the political life of the country but he did not intercede his recognition of his defeat and the congratulations he addressed to his opponent as in Head country The old foot in democracy is a ritual of receiving and receiving that takes place formally as if it does not acknowledge the legitimacy of what happened but rather the matter of his stepping down does not appear to be the revolution that public opinion cheered led to the collapse of the previous regime a definite collapse but rather it seems to those who reflect on its stages It is a temporary solution that does not end the battle a solution that Russia was his sponsor or it may be the one who proposed it as it should not be forgotten that the first public appearance of Milosevic after the popular uprising that he was supposed to have claimed was after he received the Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov and that this The latter is the first to express the will of the former Serbian dictator before the latter Plus said it This and his will is represented by his being active in public affairs a political leader almost normal in the political life of the country As for the Russian role in that regard it may be understandable Moscow is concerned with what is going on in Yugoslavia on the basis of ethnic cultural and religious traditional rapprochement McCain and she may have been so keen and it has become impossible to continue to support Milosevics stay in power in directing the transformations in Yugoslavia so that it does not lead to the transition of that country completely and to a completed manner to the Western camp with what this may mean in the future of its involvement in NATO that is from the latter39s continued expansion East and this represents some of Russia39s greatest strategic concerns and nightmares which may have seen maintaining Milosevics role in the Yugoslav affairs as some ways to prevent him at least because the former Serbian dictator has a vital interest in the personal sense in preventing any full normalization between Belgrade and Western capitals in Europe and North America However these calculations if any can only be corrected if they are based on an actual force that Milosevic still possesses and this is what appears to be the reality Why did he give up the former tyrant precisely when he recognized his opponent39s victory From the position of the presidency of Yugoslavia ie from the federal presidency and this may not be the thing that reminds and does not confer broad powers if not in terms of constitutional texts in terms of the actual reality the said federation is no longer formed after the exit of Croatia Slovenia Bosnia Herzegovina etc except from the Republic Montenegro and this small weak which is moving in the way of secession and from the Republic of Serbia and this is the nerve of federalism and the center of its power is population weight and economic weight political power and military power so that whoever does not control Serbia has no chance to control the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and that is precisely that The state of the lung The new Kostunica who is still unable to form a government to run the affairs of the country replacing it with a temporary committee similar to the crisis cell has no legal legitimacy and no constitution As for the Republic of Serbia with its government parliament and institutions including repression and coercion it is still in the hands of Milosevic And his followers from the Serbian Socialist Party and its allied parties and this together represents a force to be reckoned with which it may be able in the future to abort the Yugoslav revolution especially since the quotSerbian Democratic Oppositionquot parties wrapped around the new president are less homogeneous count on the street and this may not be the content of The mobilization is always then it often seemed breathless behind civil society organizations to strive to catch up with them and this if they have the initiative but they may not necessarily master the right political behavior in all cases because if it is good sometimes to take politics to the street to resolve An authoritarian situation as well as that which existed in Yugoslavia its long stay in it may not have a safe order of consequences and it may fall back on those who came to its advantage and in any case the forces loyal to Milosevic or those who were loyal to him failed the efforts of the new president to form his government just as She rejected his proposal to hold elections A premature sponsor next December that will lead to a new majority that reflects the current political quorum and in that may turn into a trap for the new president who saw that the existing law and legislation adhere to become the heart of the verse and make followers of the former dictator more In the interest of respecting it and if we add to that that the army is still not clear of loyalty to the new president and that the police do not define positions and if some of its units join the popular uprising and support it it may be premature to say Goodbye Milosevic because the Yugoslav revolution is still imperfect facing it Difficulties a Much has been incurred until now and its salvation may only lie in dealing with Milosevic as required by the situation of a war criminal and a criminal in the right of humanity He must be removed from public life and submitted to trial but we are in the Balkans and not in the dead Europe Shalev said that Barak by his decision to resign quotreduced the time limit available to him to bridge the gap between him and Netanyahu from six months to sixty daysquot stressing that the matter is similar to putting a person condemned to death who presents the date of implementation of the ruling He accused the former prime minister of inciting ethnic hatred and annihilating his public speeches and that he organized the delivery of weapons to civilian militias and ordered the dismissal of officials and mayors who opposed the massacres Some European countries such as Belgium pointed to the possibility of imposing sanctions reminiscent of the limited sanctions that the European Union had imposed on the government of Benjamin Netanyahu President of the European Parliament Nicole Pontin And it demanded that both the Palestinians and the Israelis take control and prevent those who want to kill peace from moving The European concern is real and the biggest is that the current crisis directly affects the European continent and led to the European currency falling significantly against the euro in front of The US dollar and the Swiss franc are the European currency that has not yet completely recovered from the effects of its recent crisis which is what calls European leaders to worry about is the absence of serious international initiatives especially since Bill Clinton is about to leave the White House within a few weeks The primary responsibility lies with the European Union and the Arab countries in this The moment to put forward the initiative to stop the bloodshed and violence Manila 1018 AFP  Officials announced that the leaders of the Philippine opposition today asked the House

about its integrity as Belgrade refused the participation of escorts from European Union countries to supervise the election process but it allowed fiftytwo observers from twelve countries not affiliated with the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to carry out the election monitoring process and the European Union had issued a statement that

during the campaign to restore the glories of the past and added We must think about the future and honor the glory of our predecessors and whatever the strength of the opposition in the competition in these elections it seems that the Yugoslav President is determined to remain in a chair The presidency at any cost did not refrain from rigging the election results which is something the opposition warned of the possibility of occurring and then the Yugoslav Prime Minister said that Milosevic has reached the end of his term regardless of the election results and directs the signal in the presidential seat to ensure his safety and his stay away from the trial as a free criminal Before the war crimes court in The Hague although the opposition candidate declared openly that he would

its attention from children to adolescents And why does that fund appear to be the most active among other UN organizations What is the nature of his activities in Iraq and Gaza Will it succeed in what the mother United Nations organization failed Many questions were asked by AlHayat to the UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa the main organizer of the forum Mr Brahima D Val is a Senegaleseborn who has been working in Jordan for nearly three years after he held several positions in a number of African countries and New York The next dialogue was what I mean expanding UNICEF39s interests in the youth category in addition to children in the past few years This expansion is due to the fact that the mandate given to us falls within the framework of defining the child as between 0 and 81 years of age and perhaps in the past we did not pay a great deal of attention between ten and eighteen years of age and through similar forums for the Amman Forum which are held all over the world increase Our knowledge of the needs of that age group and therefore our response to them does this interest reflect a decrease in the problems of children in the age group between zero and five years This is true in our region we are mining a stage of caring for the basic needs of a childs life such as nutrition food etc which has led us to expand our interests to include new issues and it may be more difficult to address which are youth issues from education drugs unemployment prostitution and engaging in conflicts And what lifestyle does UNICEF provide to children in Iraq By our standards in UNICEF a country like Iraq should not face the difficulties and problems it has been suffering for ten years We are driven to consider the issues of nutrition maternal and newborn health vaccinations and social and health development areas that under normal conditions Iraq would not have faced and  UNICEF is currently implementing the largest program in a country ever and it exceeds our program in China and India What about UNICEF39s activity in Gaza We have an office in Jerusalem another in Gaza and the Jerusalem office is normal in terms of equipment and specialized personnel and the Gaza office is smaller by virtue of the distance between the two offices and the possibility of transportation between the two and because Palestine is not yet a state our representative is a special representative and we work under the legal umbrella of the United Nations Program United Nations Development Organization UNICEF appears to be the most active among the rest of the United Nations organizations so why We are strong because our mandate is very strong which is children and our charter has won the largest number of ratifications and we are well represented and we have a large number of offices and our funding is done with voluntary assistance and not depending on contributions from governments which made our financial position stable and our name enjoys attractive and our workers They devote themselves to the organization and they enjoy the spirit of the military in their work style which is not a job they do from nine to five but it is a close connection with what they often do Criticism is directed at the United Nations for its silence in political conflicts How can an organization like UNICEF compensate for this silence The humanitarian and development side is not silent and we have to go back to the United Nations entity it is a gathering of nations and I am proud that UNICEF made a historic contribution to the work of the United Nations Last year we conducted a detailed survey in cooperation with the Government of Iraq and the impact of the embargo and war on Iraqi children and we submitted a report to The Security Council In most forums seminars and meetings everyone comes out with a huge amount of papers research and recommendations that do not find their way to real life so how does UNICEF help translate the activities of the Amman Forum into action We will take very specific steps during the next few days and of course there will be steps we must take at the regional level and steps that must be taken in each country separately and I do not think that we will start from scratch as we have already started to take steps at the regional level if you are not It is now able to define the steps that we will take to give effect to the Forums recommendations so that they do not evaporate in the air especially as they are of great importance to the United Nations governments and countries and to the young people themselves A forum for civil and nongovernmental organizations will be held in Morocco as a matter of course Rahim is a partner during the first two months of next year and there will also be a media meeting at a later time for his role in raising public opinion and all this is directed towards the special session of childhood held by the United Nations General Assembly next September Do you think that allocating a forum for NGOs Good thing A good idea but it is difficult to implement I hope that youth forums NGOs media and other events have reached parents especially since they are essential players in the field and what are the most prominent problems of youth in Senegal Their problems do not differ from the problems of the youth in the rest of the countries although they have another obstacle which is the weak economic level and perhaps the lack of attention paid to them by the government but I am satisfied with the degree of awareness that the youth of Senegal have reached so that it plays a fundamental role in determining what is the government of their country I am also happy that the minister concerned with youth is a young man in his thirties so he is one of them who understands their problems and feels them if we use the science fiction method and we assumed that only one of the youths problems could be solved which problem do you choose I will not choose a problem but to activate youth participation If the youth leaks the possibility of participation in the things that affect them this means the beginning of a new era and they will be able to challenge the problems and find solutions to them The problem is that adults think that they are dealing with issues or problems that concern young people while their problems Real is different from that chosen by adults and this is a fact not a science fiction The other members included a former fighter in the IranIraq war 19881980 an explosives expert and a former member of the Revolutionary Guards Pasdran expelled from the army military sources said Hundreds of youth groups demonstrated in Lima the capital of Peru in front of the Republican Palace demanding that President Alberto Foni

the candidates for a ministerial position in the Bush administration including retired General Colin Powell the candidate to take over the State Department and it is known that Powell was chief of staff for the Armed Forces American during the Gulf War and he is one of the most popular figures in the United States It is worth noting that the Presidentelect George W Bush is also the son of former President George W Bush an experiment that did not happen in American history except once two hundred years ago with Presidents John Adams and his son Jock Winsey Adams Bush Sr has lost the

and sixty million dollars which is a record He also received the support of American Islamic organizations Ali Abu Zakouk director of the American Islamic Center in Washington Certainly the decision of the Political Action Committee that was issued on the Coordination Council between American Islamic Associations to support Mr George Bush in the presidency had a benign effect in activating the role of the community and in voting for Bush by more than seventy percent by making sure that the Presidentelect Bushs campaign recognized this and we are in good touch with it and we think they will wait for the Muslim American community Now a look of appreciation and certainly through our political exercise we will have a role in making our voice heard and in calling for the appointment of many American Muslim elements in the main jobs in the American administration Preparations are now in full swing in preparation for the inauguration ceremony of the new American president on the twentieth of next January That the new President Bush did not take long in the atmosphere of loud celebrations like his predecessors since the first day of his presidency he must assert his legitimacy and that it will not be easy in light of the developments witnessed in the past weeks Opinion polls prior to the presidential and legislative elections in Yugoslavia indicated that the Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the leader of the National Socialist Party retreated against their rival the opposition opposition president Vojislav Kostunica On the other hand the Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Platomich announced that the Yugoslav constitution allows Milosevic to remain in power in the middle of next year regardless About the results of the presidential elections scheduled for next Sunday two days before the date of the Yugoslav elections an atmosphere of anxiety prevails in fear of what might happen in Yugoslavia after the announcement of The election results whose doubts are about its integrity as Belgrade refused the participation of escorts from European Union countries to supervise the election process but it allowed fiftytwo observers from twelve countries not affiliated with the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to carry out the election monitoring process and the European Union had issued a statement that Washington A statement in which she confirmed her intention to immediately lift economic sanctions on Yugoslavia if the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica wins and with the end of the tense election campaign Kostunica accused Milosevic of being the cause of the blockade imposed on Serbia because of his adherence to Authority The Nehio Wroche the third candidate for Serb rule called during the campaign to restore the glories of the past and added We must think about the future and honor the glory of our predecessors and whatever the strength of the opposition in the competition in these elections it seems that the Yugoslav President is determined to remain in a chair The presidency at any cost did not refrain from rigging the election results which is something the opposition warned of the possibility of occurring and then the Yugoslav Prime Minister said that Milosevic has reached the end of his term regardless of the election results and directs the signal in the presidential seat to ensure his safety and his stay away from the trial as a free criminal Before the war crimes court in The Hague although the opposition candidate declared openly that he would not cooperate with that court and hand over the defendants to it because he considers it a political court and in light of the data fear and tension hang over the Serbian street in anticipation of what the upcoming elections that many localists claim may win Milosevic in it illegally The decision to manually sort out all cards that were not counted by the sorting machines is considered a great victory for Democratic candidate Al Gore who is convinced since November 7 that the manual count will allow him to win in Florida and thus reach the White House  Some rushed to liken the transformation that Yugoslavia witnessed after its recent elections to the one that was allocated to the former Czechoslovakia during what was known as the quotvelvet revolutionquot which took place immediately after the Soviet collapse nearly a decade ago calm peaceful and smooth until almost It is a festival or a festive occasion and the analogy that had at its moment the events justifications and this if not based on the foundations of reality it certainly stems from a psychological climate from that comfort that prevailed in public opinion whether external or internal and he sees the Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic falling apart Very easily since no one was expecting a Yugoslav A if her tradeoff is to get rid of her dictator like that scenario but another completely contrary such as that which Romania had previously been a theater for for example Milosevic from the clay of Nikolai Ceausescu and that system from the clay of this regime there is no way to eradicate it except through conspiracy and violence The last days since Milosevics overthrow may have been in the process of restoring things in that regard as we are in the end in the Balkans the region of fragmentation and schism and a culture of violence and folklore revenge not in central Europe that metallic Europe that has always been a region of cultural advancement I think we are in Serbia the country of national tension The stars were people like Karadzic and by the way he used to write poetry in addition to his criminal activity at the head of the Bosnian Serbs or General Ratko Mladic not in Czechoslovakia the country of Kafka and Kundera and that was the one who took over a playwright Vaclav Havel the presidency of the republic and so on if it was  Velvet revolution in her country from the nature of things there the calm characterized by the Yugoslav transformation seems suspicious precisely because of his extreme calmness because what if Milosevic had stepped down in what appeared to be recognition of his electoral defeat against his competitor Vojislav Kostunica just a trick or a maneuver by a known man How thirsty for th Plan and to keep them and the lack of public opinion and what bothered to think he can or wants This is a question whose legitimacy has become numerous in light of the developments of the past days based on a number of evidences that have been evident and intertwined Perhaps the most striking thing in that regard is the way in which the quotYugoslavquot transformation was carried out and it is true that the supporters of the new president had occupied the parliament building And the headquarters of the official television and some other facilities and that the latter has settled in the presidency but what can be observed is that Milosevic although still free retains the right to act in the political life of the country but he did not intercede his recognition of his defeat and the congratulations he addressed to his opponent as in Head country The old foot in democracy is a ritual of receiving and receiving that takes place formally as if it does not acknowledge the legitimacy of what happened but rather the matter of his stepping down does not appear to be the revolution that public opinion cheered led to the collapse of the previous regime a definite collapse but rather it seems to those who reflect on its stages It is a temporary solution that does not end the battle a solution that Russia was his sponsor or it may be the one who proposed it as it should not be forgotten that the first public appearance of Milosevic after the popular uprising that he was supposed to have claimed was after he received the Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov and that this The latter is the first to express the will of the former Serbian dictator before the latter Plus said it This and his will is represented by his being active in public affairs a political leader almost normal in the political life of the country As for the Russian role in that regard it may be understandable Moscow is concerned with what is going on in Yugoslavia on the basis of ethnic cultural and religious traditional rapprochement McCain and she may have been so keen and it has become impossible to continue to support Milosevics stay in power in directing the transformations in Yugoslavia so that it does not lead to the transition of that country completely and to a completed manner to the Western camp with what this may mean in the future of its involvement in NATO that is from the latter39s continued expansion East and this represents some of Russia39s greatest strategic concerns and nightmares which may have seen maintaining Milosevics role in the Yugoslav affairs as some ways to prevent him at least because the former Serbian dictator has a vital interest in the personal sense in preventing any full normalization between Belgrade and Western capitals in Europe and North America However these calculations if any can only be corrected if they are based on an actual force that Milosevic still possesses and this is what appears to be the reality Why did he give up the former tyrant precisely when he recognized his opponent39s victory From the position of the presidency of Yugoslavia ie from the federal presidency and this may not be the thing that reminds and does not confer broad powers if not in terms of constitutional texts in terms of the actual reality the said federation is no longer formed after the exit of Croatia Slovenia Bosnia Herzegovina etc except from the Republic Montenegro and this small weak which is moving in the way of secession and from the Republic of Serbia and this is the nerve of federalism and the center of its power is population weight and economic weight political power and military power so that whoever does not control Serbia has no chance to control the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and that is precisely that The state of the lung The new Kostunica who is still unable to form a government to run the affairs of the country replacing it with a temporary committee similar to the crisis cell has no legal legitimacy and no constitution As for the Republic of Serbia with its government parliament and institutions including repression and coercion it is still in the hands of Milosevic And his followers from the Serbian Socialist Party and its allied parties and this together represents a force to be reckoned with which it may be able in the future to abort the Yugoslav revolution especially since the quotSerbian Democratic Oppositionquot parties wrapped around the new president are less homogeneous count on the street and this may not be the content of The mobilization is always then it often seemed breathless behind civil society organizations to strive to catch up with them and this if they have the initiative but they may not necessarily master the right political behavior in all cases because if it is good sometimes to take politics to the street to resolve An authoritarian situation as well as that which existed in Yugoslavia its long stay in it may not have a safe order of consequences and it may fall back on those who came to its advantage and in any case the forces loyal to Milosevic or those who were loyal to him failed the efforts of the new president to form his government just as She rejected his proposal to hold elections A premature sponsor next December that will lead to a new majority that reflects the current political quorum and in that may turn into a trap for the new president who saw that the existing law and legislation adhere to become the heart of the verse and make followers of the former dictator more In the interest of respecting it and if we add to that that the army is still not clear of loyalty to the new president and that the police do not define positions and if some of its units join the popular uprising and support it it may be premature to say Goodbye Milosevic because the Yugoslav revolution is still imperfect facing it Difficulties a Much has been incurred until now and its salvation may only lie in dealing with Milosevic as required by the situation of a war criminal and a criminal in the right of humanity He must be removed from public life and submitted to trial but we are in the Balkans and not in the dead Europe The Congress called Florida to hold an appeal

Judge John Cognor of the Federal Court in Seattle this week heard about a dozen people who know or associate with the Montreal painter It is noteworthy that the military court in order to complete this file reconvened three times a week after its sessions were limited to one weekly session during the judicial holiday Some rushed to liken the transformation that Yugoslavia witnessed after its recent elections to the one that was allocated to the former Czechoslovakia during what was known as the quotvelvet revolutionquot which took place immediately after the Soviet collapse nearly a decade ago calm peaceful and smooth until almost It is a festival or a festive occasion and the analogy that had at its moment the events justifications and this if not based on the foundations of reality it certainly stems from a psychological climate from that comfort that prevailed in public opinion whether external or internal and he sees the Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic falling apart Very easily since no one was expecting a Yugoslav A if her tradeoff is to get rid of her dictator like that scenario but another completely contrary such as that which Romania had previously been a theater for for example Milosevic from the clay of Nikolai Ceausescu and that system from the clay of this regime there is no way to eradicate it except through conspiracy and violence The last days since Milosevics overthrow may have been in the process of restoring things in that regard as we are in the end in the Balkans the region of fragmentation and schism and a culture of violence and folklore revenge not in central Europe that metallic Europe that has always been a region of cultural advancement I think we are in Serbia the country of national tension The stars were people like Karadzic and by the way he used to write poetry in addition to his criminal activity at the head of the Bosnian Serbs or General Ratko Mladic not in Czechoslovakia the country of Kafka and Kundera and that was the one who took over a playwright Vaclav Havel the presidency of the republic and so on if it was  Velvet revolution in her country from the nature of things there the calm characterized by the Yugoslav transformation seems suspicious precisely because of his extreme calmness because what if Milosevic had stepped down in what appeared to be recognition of his electoral defeat against his competitor Vojislav Kostunica just a trick or a maneuver by a known man How thirsty for th Plan and to keep them and the lack of public opinion and what bothered to think he can or wants This is a question whose legitimacy has become numerous in light of the developments of the past days based on a number of evidences that have been evident and intertwined Perhaps the most striking thing in that regard is the way in which the quotYugoslavquot transformation was carried out and it is true that the supporters of the new president had occupied the parliament building And the headquarters of the official television and some other facilities and that the latter has settled in the presidency but what can be observed is that Milosevic although still free retains the right to act in the political life of the country but he did not intercede his recognition of his defeat and the congratulations he addressed to his opponent as in Head country The old foot in democracy is a ritual of receiving and receiving that takes place formally as if it does not acknowledge the legitimacy of what happened but rather the matter of his stepping down does not appear to be the revolution that public opinion cheered led to the collapse of the previous regime a definite collapse but rather it seems to those who reflect on its stages It is a temporary solution that does not end the battle a solution that Russia was his sponsor or it may be the one who proposed it as it should not be forgotten that the first public appearance of Milosevic after the popular uprising that he was supposed to have claimed was after he received the Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov and that this The latter is the first to express the will of the former Serbian dictator before the latter Plus said it This and his will is represented by his being active in public affairs a political leader almost normal in the political life of the country As for the Russian role in that regard it may be understandable Moscow is concerned with what is going on in Yugoslavia on the basis of ethnic cultural and religious traditional rapprochement McCain and she may have been so keen and it has become impossible to continue to support Milosevics stay in power in directing the transformations in Yugoslavia so that it does not lead to the transition of that country completely and to a completed manner to the Western camp with what this may mean in the future of its involvement in NATO that is from the latter39s continued expansion East and this represents some of Russia39s greatest strategic concerns and nightmares which may have seen maintaining Milosevics role in the Yugoslav affairs as some ways to prevent him at least because the former Serbian dictator has a vital interest in the personal sense in preventing any full normalization between Belgrade and Western capitals in Europe and North America However these calculations if any can only be corrected if they are based on an actual force that Milosevic still possesses and this is what appears to be the reality Why did he give up the former tyrant precisely when he recognized his opponent39s victory From the position of the presidency of Yugoslavia ie from the federal presidency and this may not be the thing that reminds and does not confer broad powers if not in terms of constitutional texts in terms of the actual reality the said federation is no longer formed after the exit of Croatia Slovenia Bosnia Herzegovina etc except from the Republic Montenegro and this small weak which is moving in the way of secession and from the Republic of Serbia and this is the nerve of federalism and the center of its power is population weight and economic weight political power and military power so that whoever does not control Serbia has no chance to control the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and that is precisely that The state of the lung The new Kostunica who is still unable to form a government to run the affairs of the country replacing it with a temporary committee similar to the crisis cell has no legal legitimacy and no constitution As for the Republic of Serbia with its government parliament and institutions including repression and coercion it is still in the hands of Milosevic And his followers from the Serbian Socialist Party and its allied parties and this together represents a force to be reckoned with which it may be able in the future to abort the Yugoslav revolution especially since the quotSerbian Democratic Oppositionquot parties wrapped around the new president are less homogeneous count on the street and this may not be the content of The mobilization is always then it often seemed breathless behind civil society organizations to strive to catch up with them and this if they have the initiative but they may not necessarily master the right political behavior in all cases because if it is good sometimes to take politics to the street to resolve An authoritarian situation as well as that which existed in Yugoslavia its long stay in it may not have a safe order of consequences and it may fall back on those who came to its advantage and in any case the forces loyal to Milosevic or those who were loyal to him failed the efforts of the new president to form his government just as She rejected his proposal to hold elections A premature sponsor next December that will lead to a new majority that reflects the current political quorum and in that may turn into a trap for the new president who saw that the existing law and legislation adhere to become the heart of the verse and make followers of the former dictator more In the interest of respecting it and if we add to that that the army is still not clear of loyalty to the new president and that the police do not define positions and if some of its units join the popular uprising and support it it may be premature to say Goodbye Milosevic because the Yugoslav revolution is still imperfect facing it Difficulties a Much has been incurred until now and its salvation may only lie in dealing with Milosevic as required by the situation of a war criminal and a criminal in the right of humanity He must be removed from public life and submitted to trial but we are in the Balkans and not in the dead Europe quotThe trial of 18 persons involved in this case is taking place in the presence of their attorneysquot he said stressing that the court will issue a quottranscriptquot of Monday39s session later in the day Opinion polls prior to the presidential and legislative elections in Yugoslavia indicated that the Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the leader of the National Socialist Party retreated against their rival the opposition opposition president Vojislav Kostunica On the other hand the Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Platomich announced that the Yugoslav constitution allows Milosevic to remain in power in the middle of next year regardless About the results of the presidential elections scheduled for next Sunday two days before the date of the Yugoslav elections an atmosphere of anxiety prevails in fear of what might happen in Yugoslavia after the announcement of The election results whose doubts are about its integrity as Belgrade refused the participation of escorts from European Union countries to supervise the election process but it allowed fiftytwo observers from twelve countries not affiliated with the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to carry out the election monitoring process and the European Union had issued a statement that Washington A statement in which she confirmed her intention to immediately lift economic sanctions on Yugoslavia if the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica wins and with the end of the tense election campaign Kostunica accused Milosevic of being the cause of the blockade imposed on Serbia because of his adherence to Authority The Nehio Wroche the third candidate for Serb rule called during the campaign to restore the glories of the past and added We must think about the future and honor the glory of our predecessors and whatever the strength of the opposition in the competition in these elections it seems that the Yugoslav President is determined to remain in a chair The presidency at any cost did not refrain from rigging the election results which is something the opposition warned of the possibility of occurring and then the Yugoslav Prime Minister said that Milosevic has reached the end of his term regardless of the election results and directs the signal in the presidential seat to ensure his safety and his stay away from the trial as a free criminal Before the war crimes court in The Hague although the opposition candidate declared openly that he would not cooperate with that court and hand over the defendants to it because he considers it a political court and in light of the data fear and tension hang over the Serbian street in anticipation of what the upcoming elections that many localists claim may win Milosevic in it illegally The television added that the session started in front of the 20th indictment chamber in the Revolutionary Court of Tehran without providing any clarifications regarding the accused The trial session of the accused accused of the assassination of the former official of the Islamic Salvation Front Sheikh Abdel

sphere have become the main topic in discussions of the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Army Genzel Anna Tolk Bachten with the chief of the American Chief of Staff General Henry H Shell Don who has prevented E Bad air money from arriving in the Russian capital at a specific time as long as he concluded his visit to Moscow These discussions took place to meet President Putin39s new policy towards the United States which is determined by several goals that are aimed at and to the Kremlins achievement including persuading the United States to abandon the establishment of a defense system New Demanding the US administration to work to reduce its nuclear arsenal insisting on continuing military cooperation with Iran as part of the measures aimed at strengthening regional security and in a joint press conference held after the end of the talks across Sheldon from Washington39s concern about Russia39s return to cooperation And the military with Tehran this issue was discussed in Brooks for the past week at the level of defense ministers of two countries and it is natural that it raises our concern because it might lead to the sidelining of the situation in the region but General Bouchtine tried to dispel these concerns If we discuss this issue and there is no problem we will work in accordance with the agreements reached for the benefit of the international community and bilateral relations On the other hand Russia still strongly opposes Washingtons intention to deploy its new defense systems and even if it becomes clear that the new American administration will not abandon such plans Moscow possesses what it says on it this is what it says To him political analyst Dr Andre Spornos the position of the Russian Federation as it is known stands against the American defense system and the development of Russia according to Putin39s statements and according to what we know its mobile nuclear weapon capable of achieving targets under this regardless of any defense system as the Russian military said And Russia is now counting on its European allies opposed to American plans who supported a new Russian initiative on establishing a nonstrategic defense system across the European continent Sheldon39s visit to Moscow will not clearly answer a question regarding the possibility of settling RussianAmerican differences in the public sphere It is clear and clear that Russia has a different vision of how to achieve a new strategic balance in order to reduce American domination of the world Israel has postponed the deadline it set to respond strongly to the Palestinian demonstrations and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said after extending the deadline he set fortyeight hours that he gives Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat several more days to control

made them make this decision More than ninety people most of them Palestinians were killed in the twelve days of fighting between Israeli soldiers and protesters Palestinians and clashes are still

diplomatic efforts to end the violence and he is proud I m phoned again with Messrs Barak and Arafat and a White House spokesman said that holding a PalestinianIsraeli summit meeting is one of the

front of his house in the village of Artas near the city of Bethlehem during an exchange of fire between Israeli soldiers and unidentified gunmen were running in the area bringing the number of martyrs of the AlAqsa Intifada to three hundred and twentytwo martyrs despite the relative calm that prevailed in the Palestinian territories but sporadic confrontations erupted between Palestinian youths and the Israeli army in Ramallah and the northern street in Israel Khalil resulted in dozens of Palestinians suffering from gas asphyxiation while the Israeli army bulldozed extensive lands in the Triangle of Villars and Dura villages south of Hebron and stormed a number of Nablus villages and strengthened its presence at the entrances of Palestinian cities in Gaza the West Bank and Jerusalem Israeli newspapers announced the intention of Israel Increasing the number of Israeli soldiers in the socalled Israeli special units to three times because they are deployed inside the

aggression and return to the negotiating table The situation seems better than before We are continuing our contacts but things are going slowly and there are still many obstacles It is mentioned that the Palestinian demand calling for the participation of international parties in the negotiations A rejected by Israeli Prime Minister still Only three sessions will be held by the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council states during their summit that begins in Bahrain tomorrow Saturday and will continue for two days and this indicates that the twentyfirst Gulf summit will be a normal summit and there are no issues of controversy or controversy and the calm Gulf atmosphere in which the summit is held makes the files presented On its agenda are routine files that do not require that the six Gulf leaders and leaders hold two sessions of work the first is following the public opening session tomorrow afternoon and the second precedes the public closing session that will be held on Sunday afternoon and if there are political issues that will raise some of the The discussion and discussion during the Bahrain Gulf Summit it is limited to only two main issues First the position of the Gulf Cooperation Council states towards Iran in light of Tehran39s lack of response to the efforts of the tripartite Gulf Ministerial Committee to persuade Iran to negotiate with the UAE on the dispute over the three Emirati islands the Greater Tunb Lesser Tunb and Abu Moussa occupied by Iran since 1791 it is assumed that this committee which includes the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia Qatar and the Sultanate of Oman should report on the results of its mission to the summit and no one doubts that this committee has not achieved any positive results because of Iran39s lack of response to its endeavors It has started it since the summer of 1999 and the UAE wants from the summit an explicit decision to do so It also wants to stop the work of this committee and not to go far in the Gulf relations with Iran Relations have improved since the election of President Muhammad Khatami in the year 1997 and the question before the summit is whether the tripartite committee continues its mission Perhaps Tehran will one day respond to its efforts and agree to meet its members to discuss with them ways of conducting a dialogue with the Emirates on the dispute over the three islands Or does the Tripartite Commission stop its work leaving the issue to bilateral contacts Secondly the situation between Iraq and Kuwait and is expected to be the subject of controversy and debate during the work of the Bahrain summit It is known that the foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries when they met last month to prepare for the summit discussed the Iraqi issue in light of the emergence of regional and international changes towards the situation in Iraq and these variables are reversed by mitigation The blockade imposed on Iraq through repeated flights by countries affiliated with the international antiIraq coalition and some even calculated on the United States and through quotturning a blind eyequot to Iraq smuggling large quantities of its oil through Syria and other countries Foreign ministers of the Cooperation Council during their meeting last month to Kuwait prepared a paper in coordination with Saudi Arabia regarding the quotIraqi situationquot and 21 days ago the foreign ministers39 representatives of the GCC countries met in Manama and studied the Kuwaiti paper and it was not possible to know the Gulf position on the ideas contained in the paper except from Kuwaiti sources She said There was no reservation from the member states on the content of the Kuwaiti paper which will be a clear message to Iraq demanding the implementation of all Security Council resolutions And if this is true it means that the Kuwaiti ideas included in the paper related to the Iraqi situation came flexible and liberal The old Kuwaiti nodes as the approval of all the Gulf states means that they took into consideration the Qatari and Emirati ideas that called for and called for openness to the Iraqi situation and deal positively with regional and international changes towards Iraq how this interaction will take place this is what will be discussed by the leaders of the six Gulf countries and the Gulf summits are used to On the controversy in the issues of Iran and Iraq since the establishment of the Cooperation Council in 1891 it did not reflect differences that could strain the atmosphere of previous summits nor this quiet summit Perhaps the calmness of the atmosphere of the Bahrain summit will make the leaders of the six Gulf states focus on researching issues of Gulf citizenship and How to achieve a dream that has been in the region for twenty years</text>

<text> Welcome we start our hour from Cairo where President Hosni Mubarak expressed his aspiration for a new phase of close cooperation between US Presidentelect George Bush Jr in order to support the excellent bilateral relations between Egypt and the United States and to reach a just and lasting peace in the Middle East This came in a congratulatory message sent By President Mubarak to US Presidentelect George W Bush On the other hand the new American President George W Bush began his consultations to form his new administration that will take power in the United States on the twentieth of next January George Bush Jr was the fortythird president in the history of America The United States has pledged to work to eliminate the effects of the legal dispute that lasted for more than a month with his Democratic rival Gore over the White House George W Bush began his first day as an elected president by attending some religious and musical rituals in a church in Austin Texas in what his aides described It is a message for healing wounds after five weeks of violent conflict in the courts and ended with his victory in the White House and the Vice President and Democratic candidate Al Gore mentioned in his withdrawal speech that he disagreed with the Federal Supreme Court ruling to stop the manual counting of votes in Florida which led to Bush39s victory but in At the same time he affirmed his acceptance of the wisdom rule and called for standing one rank behind the new president and all of them received a great praise from commentators here As for Presidentelect Bush he made his festive victory speech before the House of Representatives of Texas with his democratic majority in a symbolic message that he would seek to reach out to the democratic opposition in Washington Bush has used a quiet language that does not boast of his victory in an effort to calm the burning feelings He stressed that he will be the president of all Americans and will defend the interests of everyone including those who voted against him He also called for overcoming the bitterness of the past weeks experience Bush will meet Gore on Tuesday Adam in Washington to confirm the message of reconciliation and from London President Clinton called the Presidentelect Bush and congratulated him and praised his festive speech and Clinton assured him that his administration will make all its endeavors to transfer power smoothly to the new administration as the American President asked for unity in the row behind the new president and the vice presidentelect continues Dick Cheney his consultations to transfer power to the new administration is expected to announce shortly the names of some of the candidates for a ministerial position in the Bush administration including retired General Colin Powell the candidate to take over the State Department and it is known that Powell was chief of staff for the Armed Forces American during the Gulf War and he is one of the most popular figures in the United States It is worth noting that the Presidentelect George W Bush is also the son of former President George W Bush an experiment that did not happen in American history except once two hundred years ago with Presidents John Adams and his son Jock Winsey Adams Bush Sr has lost the elections in ninetytwo in front of the current President Bill Clinton and his deputy Al Gore However the new president says that he has no vengeance Bush39s sons experience in public work is relatively few It started in ninetyfour when he won the Governors election in Texas and then was repeated His election year w In the last presidential elections George W Bush spent about one hundred and sixty million dollars which is a record He also received the support of American Islamic organizations Ali Abu Zakouk director of the American Islamic Center in Washington Certainly the decision of the Political Action Committee that was issued on the Coordination Council between American Islamic Associations to support Mr George Bush in the presidency had a benign effect in activating the role of the community and in voting for Bush by more than seventy percent by making sure that the Presidentelect Bushs campaign recognized this and we are in good touch with it and we think they will wait for the Muslim American community Now a look of appreciation and certainly through our political exercise we will have a role in making our voice heard and in calling for the appointment of many American Muslim elements in the main jobs in the American administration Preparations are now in full swing in preparation for the inauguration ceremony of the new American president on the twentieth of next January That the new President Bush did not take long in the atmosphere of loud celebrations like his predecessors since the first day of his presidency he must assert his legitimacy and that it will not be easy in light of the developments witnessed in the past weeks In Istanbul and within the same group as well the appointment of Louis Fernandez as coach of Paris Saint Germain in France did not cause a positive shock in the hearts of the players because they lost against Galatasarays Turkish goal with a goal scored by Omen Davala in the 51st minute of a penalty that was calculated due to the betrayal of the Moroccan defender Talal AlKarkouri Brazilian striker Mario Gardel  The parties that brought Waheed to power on October 20 1999 for five years criticize the political and economic outcome of the president of the fourth most populous country in the world 210 million people Some rushed to liken the transformation that Yugoslavia witnessed after its recent elections to the one that was allocated to the former Czechoslovakia during what was known as the quotvelvet revolutionquot which took place immediately after the Soviet collapse nearly a decade ago calm peaceful and smooth until almost It is a festival or a festive occasion and the analogy that had at its moment the events justifications and this if not based on the foundations of reality it certainly stems from a psychological climate from that comfort that prevailed in public opinion whether external or internal and he sees the Serbian tyrant Slobodan Milosevic falling apart Very easily since no one was expecting a Yugoslav A if her tradeoff is to get rid of her dictator like that scenario but another completely contrary such as that which Romania had previously been a theater for for example Milosevic from the clay of Nikolai Ceausescu and that system from the clay of this regime there is no way to eradicate it except through conspiracy and violence The last days since Milosevics overthrow may have been in the process of restoring things in that regard as we are in the end in the Balkans the region of fragmentation and schism and a culture of violence and folklore revenge not in central Europe that metallic Europe that has always been a region of cultural advancement I think we are in Serbia the country of national tension The stars were people like Karadzic and by the way he used to write poetry in addition to his criminal activity at the head of the Bosnian Serbs or General Ratko Mladic not in Czechoslovakia the country of Kafka and Kundera and that was the one who took over a playwright Vaclav Havel the presidency of the republic and so on if it was  Velvet revolution in her country from the nature of things there the calm characterized by the Yugoslav transformation seems suspicious precisely because of his extreme calmness because what if Milosevic had stepped down in what appeared to be recognition of his electoral defeat against his competitor Vojislav Kostunica just a trick or a maneuver by a known man How thirsty for th Plan and to keep them and the lack of public opinion and what bothered to think he can or wants This is a question whose legitimacy has become numerous in light of the developments of the past days based on a number of evidences that have been evident and intertwined Perhaps the most striking thing in that regard is the way in which the quotYugoslavquot transformation was carried out and it is true that the supporters of the new president had occupied the parliament building And the headquarters of the official television and some other facilities and that the latter has settled in the presidency but what can be observed is that Milosevic although still free retains the right to act in the political life of the country but he did not intercede his recognition of his defeat and the congratulations he addressed to his opponent as in Head country The old foot in democracy is a ritual of receiving and receiving that takes place formally as if it does not acknowledge the legitimacy of what happened but rather the matter of his stepping down does not appear to be the revolution that public opinion cheered led to the collapse of the previous regime a definite collapse but rather it seems to those who reflect on its stages It is a temporary solution that does not end the battle a solution that Russia was his sponsor or it may be the one who proposed it as it should not be forgotten that the first public appearance of Milosevic after the popular uprising that he was supposed to have claimed was after he received the Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov and that this The latter is the first to express the will of the former Serbian dictator before the latter Plus said it This and his will is represented by his being active in public affairs a political leader almost normal in the political life of the country As for the Russian role in that regard it may be understandable Moscow is concerned with what is going on in Yugoslavia on the basis of ethnic cultural and religious traditional rapprochement McCain and she may have been so keen and it has become impossible to continue to support Milosevics stay in power in directing the transformations in Yugoslavia so that it does not lead to the transition of that country completely and to a completed manner to the Western camp with what this may mean in the future of its involvement in NATO that is from the latter39s continued expansion East and this represents some of Russia39s greatest strategic concerns and nightmares which may have seen maintaining Milosevics role in the Yugoslav affairs as some ways to prevent him at least because the former Serbian dictator has a vital interest in the personal sense in preventing any full normalization between Belgrade and Western capitals in Europe and North America However these calculations if any can only be corrected if they are based on an actual force that Milosevic still possesses and this is what appears to be the reality Why did he give up the former tyrant precisely when he recognized his opponent39s victory From the position of the presidency of Yugoslavia ie from the federal presidency and this may not be the thing that reminds and does not confer broad powers if not in terms of constitutional texts in terms of the actual reality the said federation is no longer formed after the exit of Croatia Slovenia Bosnia Herzegovina etc except from the Republic Montenegro and this small weak which is moving in the way of secession and from the Republic of Serbia and this is the nerve of federalism and the center of its power is population weight and economic weight political power and military power so that whoever does not control Serbia has no chance to control the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and that is precisely that The state of the lung The new Kostunica who is still unable to form a government to run the affairs of the country replacing it with a temporary committee similar to the crisis cell has no legal legitimacy and no constitution As for the Republic of Serbia with its government parliament and institutions including repression and coercion it is still in the hands of Milosevic And his followers from the Serbian Socialist Party and its allied parties and this together represents a force to be reckoned with which it may be able in the future to abort the Yugoslav revolution especially since the quotSerbian Democratic Oppositionquot parties wrapped around the new president are less homogeneous count on the street and this may not be the content of The mobilization is always then it often seemed breathless behind civil society organizations to strive to catch up with them and this if they have the initiative but they may not necessarily master the right political behavior in all cases because if it is good sometimes to take politics to the street to resolve An authoritarian situation as well as that which existed in Yugoslavia its long stay in it may not have a safe order of consequences and it may fall back on those who came to its advantage and in any case the forces loyal to Milosevic or those who were loyal to him failed the efforts of the new president to form his government just as She rejected his proposal to hold elections A premature sponsor next December that will lead to a new majority that reflects the current political quorum and in that may turn into a trap for the new president who saw that the existing law and legislation adhere to become the heart of the verse and make followers of the former dictator more In the interest of respecting it and if we add to that that the army is still not clear of loyalty to the new president and that the police do not define positions and if some of its units join the popular uprising and support it it may be premature to say Goodbye Milosevic because the Yugoslav revolution is still imperfect facing it Difficulties a Much has been incurred until now and its salvation may only lie in dealing with Milosevic as required by the situation of a war criminal and a criminal in the right of humanity He must be removed from public life and submitted to trial but we are in the Balkans and not in the dead Europe The

of the American destroyer quotColequot in the port of Aden which killed 71 American sailors from the quotMarinesquot are heading towards condemning Osama bin Laden and the former leader of the Egyptian quotjihadquot group Dr Ayman alZawahiri who currently live in Afghanistan and others belonging to them residing in Yemen and AlHayat learned that investigators of the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI affiliated to the American Embassy in Cairo have started efforts to find information about the activities of Egyptian elements that were linked for a while to bin Laden and alZawahiri in Afghanistan and then they headed to Yemen and others still residing in Afghanistan turned out to have trained quotIslamic suicide bombersquot in preparing explosives and organizing suicide operations and the sources stated that among those who Americans seek to know about their history is the Egyptian chemical engineer Medhat Morsi who is known among the fundamentalists as quotAbu Khababquot who turned out to be from He went to the coastal province of Alexandria and got a Bachelor of Science from her university at the end of the seventies and he left Egypt in the eighties and toured several countries until he settled in Afghanistan where he worked as an expert in the field of explosives taking advantage of his academic experiences and cooperated with several fundamentalist organizations taken from Afghan lands throughout the eighties until the early nineties centers and sources added that Abu Khabab officially joined the midnineties to the quotAlQaedaquot organization founded by Osama bin Laden and quickly raised the organizational ladder as a result of his high efficiency in training the organization39s members until he became the third man in quotAlQaedaquot after Ibn Laden and his assistant Subaihi Abu Sitta known as Abu Hafs alMasri who is in command of the military action of the organization and the sources suggested that the perpetrators of the Aden operation were trained by Abu Khabab noting that the man undertook these tasks after the killing of the former military leader of alQaeda Ali alRashidi known as the father And Obaida AlTabashiri who died by drowning in an African lake in the midnineties and the sources confirmed that the initial indications of the investigations are heading towards not linking the bombing of the Cole and the explosion that took place at the British embassy in Sana39a on the second day as it was found that the embassy bombing was carried out in a primitive way from Throwing a bomb that caused it to fall on the electricity board inside the embassy added to the force of the detonation while the detonation of the destroyer was a carefully planned action according to a scheme similar to the bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998 It may be that the talk about seeing the crescent of Ramadan came late now and more than half of the blessed month has passed but with the abundance of what has been written about Ramadan affairs in this month of fasting there is still something that can be added and it is known that the first judge in Egypt went out with people to see the crescent Ramadan is the judge Ibn Lahiya AlMaqrizi the famous historian of Egypt narrated that he was in the Mokattam Mountain a deck which is a tall rectangular seat known as the bench of judges and they used to go out to observe the crescent and the Fatimids had special matters related to Ramadan including that in the three days preceding the holy month the judges were with them Those who take refuge in the Gate of the Caliph the Witnesses and the followers wander around all the nightmares D they lose their brushes and architecture and they work to remove the shag and dust in them so that they are usable in this month I do not intend to talk about Ramadan celebrations before not until now but I want to pass on to our esteemed readers what I knew about the Ramadan cannon to announce the time of suhoor and then Constipation from food and the time of breaking the fast when the fasting people are blessed with the blessings that God has bestowed on them of their livelihoods History tells us that the custom of firing the Ramadan cannon started in Egypt at the end of the Mamluk era that is before Muhammad Ali assumed the mandate of Egypt in the year 5081 one of these governors bought a European cannon and wanted To try it and launch attempts took a long time and This happened on one of the days of Ramadan and the vulva did not come and the cannon set off only when the day signaled the end and the muezzins went up to the minarets to call on the ears of Morocco Although the matter was just a coincidence people thought that the governor wanted to warn them that the time for breakfast had come and then The firing of the cannon is usually proven at the time of breakfast and suhur and the current breakfast cannon that is launched in Egypt goes back to the days of Muhammad Ali Pasha the ruler of Egypt from 5081 to 1948 The first cannon was made in Germany and inscribed on it quotKrupp 9quot and Krupp was one of the largest weapons factories in Europe for a period Long in the Egyptian archives records that this cannon He participated in military battles before and when it was time for him to retire stay in his current location near Salah ElDin Castle and a thousand people on that day to watch the governor and rulers wearing official quothonorablequot clothes and head to the castle for special celebrations to attend the sighting of the crescent and celebrate the month of fasting which he was announcing For the people of this cannon and its successors after it and as long as we refer to the month of Ramadan which Muslims around the world bless let us mention something about its special dishes in Egypt the most famous of which is the fava beans dish the tarshi dish and the pickled municipalities and there are nuts that are served after breakfast and the custom took place in the popular neighborhoods so that customers do not buy Fava beans or thrash only an hour before breakfast or a little more than that believing that the dishes are ready fresh and I have witnessed a crowd of this kind on AlMosky Street in Cairo on a visit to me more than half a century ago and what I remember about that visit are pictures published in a magazine quotThe photographerquot for breakfast hosted by quotIslam Pashaquot for a group of friends and tableware of beans topped the magazine The magazine insisted on the day saying that Islam Pasha sent his private car to Mansoura north of Cairo at a great distance because he was a famous fan so he wanted his guests to enjoy his beans and wanted It is to mention the press with care to delight him Loyal friends When I visited Cairo in the middle of the year 2000 it was not the time for Ramadan but the city with a population of 31 million at night and about 61 million in the day and enjoying the noise of cars and their horns are deafening I dont think people care about hearing the Ramadan cannon that is still fired From the castle every evening or until the muezzins voice was poor the Ramadan cannon made the noise lose its joy and became screaming in the wilderness Oliveira returns to Benfica six years after his leadership leading to his last league title 1994</text>

the United States on the twentieth of next January George Bush Jr was the fortythird president in the history of America The United States has pledged to work to eliminate the effects of the legal dispute that lasted for more than a month with his Democratic rival Gore over the White House George W Bush began his first day as an elected president by attending some religious and musical rituals in a church in Austin Texas in what his aides described It is a message for healing wounds after five weeks of violent conflict in the courts and ended with his victory in the White House and the Vice President and Democratic candidate Al Gore mentioned in his withdrawal speech that he disagreed with the Federal Supreme Court ruling to stop the manual counting of votes in Florida which led to Bush39s victory but in At the same time he affirmed his acceptance of the wisdom rule and called for standing one rank behind the new president and all of them received a great praise from commentators here As for Presidentelect Bush he made his festive victory speech before the House of Representatives of Texas with his democratic majority in a symbolic message that he would seek to reach out to the democratic opposition in Washington Bush has used a quiet language that does not boast of his victory in an effort to calm the burning feelings He stressed that he will be the president of all Americans and will defend the interests of everyone including those who voted against him He also called for overcoming the bitterness of the past weeks experience Bush will meet Gore on Tuesday Adam in Washington to confirm the message of reconciliation and from London President Clinton called the Presidentelect Bush and congratulated him and praised his festive speech and Clinton

position in the Bush administration including retired General Colin Powell the candidate to take over the State Department and it is known that Powell was chief of staff for the Armed Forces American during the Gulf War and he is one of the most popular figures in the United States It is worth noting that the Presidentelect George W Bush is also the son of former President George W Bush an experiment that did not happen in American history except once two hundred years ago with Presidents John Adams and his son Jock Winsey Adams Bush Sr has lost the elections in ninetytwo in front of the current President Bill Clinton and his deputy Al Gore However the new president says that he has no vengeance Bush39s sons experience in public work is relatively few It started in ninetyfour when he won the Governors election in Texas and then was repeated His election year w In the last presidential elections George W Bush spent about one hundred and sixty million dollars which is a record He also received the support of American Islamic organizations Ali Abu Zakouk director of the American Islamic Center in Washington Certainly the decision of the Political Action Committee that was issued on the Coordination Council between American Islamic Associations to support Mr George Bush in the presidency had a benign effect in activating the role of the community and in voting for Bush by more than seventy percent by making sure that the Presidentelect Bushs campaign recognized this and we are in good touch with it and we think they will wait for the Muslim American community Now a look of appreciation and certainly through our political exercise we will have a role in making our voice heard and in calling for the appointment of many American Muslim elements in the main jobs in

time to time there we hear bullets especially by the army and settlers who are attacking Palestinians in some areas near the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza I want to say that yesterday morning there was relative calm prevailing in Palestinian cities but Soon the confrontations renewed at noon most of these confrontations were caused by the attacks of the Jewish settlers against the Palestinians by shooting at homes and cars and razing some lands There were very strong confrontations and now after the Sharm elSheikh agreement took place in Nablus the beginning of the two settlements The Israelis shot some Palestinians when he was called Josephs Tomb in the city of Nablus which led to the martyrdom of a twentyfouryearold Palestinian but the other Palestinian was killed due to the bullets of the Israeli helicopter gunships that landed on the Askar refugee camp in Nablus which lasted for hours and ended only before nearly An hour or an hour and a half ago after an

alternative to a peaceful settlement of this crisis It is worth noting that analysts believe that Russias position will be characterized by balance and moderation during discussion The crisis is in an

<text> Yesterday the court session that examined the Palestinian appeal Jawad AlButma and Samar AlAlami suspended the decision of their conviction for quotconspiring to causequot two explosions at the Israeli embassy and quotBalfour Housequot in London in July 1994 after their lawyer Michael Mansfield told the court that someone called the day before yesterday One of the members of the defense team lawyer Gareth Pearce provided her with information that could shed light on the embassy bombing Mansfield said that the person who called Pearce mentioned that the information was originally provided to the police and it is assumed that he did so before the two bombings in 1994 and Pearce maintains the name of the person who transmitted the information to a center The police and the names of the police officers who were given them and Mansfield said that the defense team intends to provide this information in a letter to the Public Prosecution Authority to verify whether it is registered and asked Mansfield to give the defense team some time to follow up on this new information as well as the information that was given to him the day before yesterday that the security apparatus The British MI5 had received a warning about the bombing and Mansfield wanted to also consult with George Jovi and Yazid Sayegh who were represented as defense experts during the trial of alButma and AlAlami in December 1996 and the Palestinians were sentenced to 20 years in prison after being convicted by a body Jurors Judge Rose who heads the threejudge court announced that in light of what Mansfield said the session should be suspended but he warned that the trial may not be resumed until several months later because the three judges have other obligations and the consideration of the appeal in the Supreme Court began Tuesday In the past the police had said during the trial in 1996 that there was an quotintelligence vacuumquot in the case while the judge announced at the end of the trial that a large number of questions remained unanswered but the defense team believes that there is a large amount of intelligence that can show that a decision Condemn the Lamy and alButma are not trusted and should be canceled by the Court of Appeal but the defense faces as the court sessions showed significant obstacles that prevent it from obtaining any of this information With the aim of helping the Palestinians in the occupied territories and mentioning that a Palestinian named Reda AlMughrabi is still unknown he fabricated against them the charge of conspiracy to carry out the bombing operations and the prosecution questioned whether the Moroccan was indeed present but the defense hopes that the new information will be consistent with the statements of alButmah and alAlam Y during the trial regarding AlMaghrabi39s presence and activities in London the defense team argues that the party that carried out the bombings was an organized group and perhaps related to the Iranian or Israeli government Judges Mansfield was briefed the day before yesterday on a summary of some of the information that was previously classified showed that the MI5 And the quotspecial branchquot of the London Police obtained before the bombing of the Israeli embassy evidence from a quotclientquot that a terrorist organization was seeking information about the embassy site in London and its protection arrangements but such information was not provided to that terrorist organization and did not carry out the bombings And she said to me SR after the suspension of the session yesterday They provided us with a small amount of information that does not provide any help at all We are exploring around us such as a blind man carrying a white stick which highlights the extent of the prejudice of procedural issues when they are all behind closed doors and pointed out that the Court of Appeal ignored the European Courts decision When I decided to examine confidential documents in a closed session it is the first time that the Court of Appeal has faced the European Charter for Human Rights since it was included in British law this month Sudan has ordered an American diplomat to leave Khartoum after it was reported that he was involved in a plot with opposition leaders to carry out an uprising News of the armed police forces in Djibouti besieged the house of President

were convicted on April 6 of endangering the lives of more than 200 people at risk by trying to prevent the landing of the plane coming from Sri Lanka including General Pervez Musharraf whom Sharif had sacked hours before the army command Western sources in Cairo confirmed that the investigations conducted by American investigators regarding the bombing of the American destroyer quotColequot in the port of Aden which killed 71 American sailors from the quotMarinesquot are heading towards condemning Osama bin Laden and the former leader of the Egyptian quotjihadquot group Dr Ayman alZawahiri who currently live in Afghanistan and others belonging to them residing in Yemen and AlHayat learned that investigators of the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI affiliated to the American Embassy in Cairo have started efforts to find information about the activities of Egyptian elements that were linked for a while to bin Laden and alZawahiri in Afghanistan and then they headed to Yemen and others still residing in Afghanistan turned out to have trained quotIslamic suicide bombersquot in preparing explosives and organizing suicide operations and the sources stated that among those who Americans seek to know about their history is the Egyptian chemical engineer Medhat Morsi who is known among the fundamentalists as quotAbu Khababquot who turned out to be from He went to the coastal province of Alexandria and got a Bachelor of Science from her university at the end of the seventies and he left Egypt in the eighties and toured several countries until he settled in Afghanistan where he worked as an expert in the field of explosives taking advantage of his academic experiences and cooperated with several fundamentalist organizations taken from Afghan lands throughout the eighties until the early nineties centers and sources added that Abu Khabab officially joined the midnineties to the quotAlQaedaquot organization founded by Osama bin Laden and quickly raised the organizational ladder as a result of his high efficiency in training the organization39s members until he became the third man in quotAlQaedaquot after Ibn Laden and his assistant Subaihi Abu Sitta known as Abu Hafs alMasri who is in command of the military action of the organization and the sources suggested that the perpetrators of the Aden operation were trained by Abu Khabab noting that the man undertook these tasks after the killing of the former military leader of alQaeda Ali alRashidi known as the father And Obaida AlTabashiri who died by drowning in an African lake in the midnineties and the sources confirmed that the initial indications of the investigations are heading towards not linking the bombing of the Cole and the explosion that took place at the British embassy in Sana39a on the second day as it was found that the embassy bombing was carried out in a primitive way from Throwing a bomb that caused it to fall on the electricity board inside the embassy added to the force of the detonation while the detonation of the destroyer was a carefully planned action according to a scheme similar to the bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998 Like the captain of a Greek ship and three of its sailors they were accused of manslaughter in the accident of the shipwreck last week They appeared today before a court just an hour after another ship

Egypt narrated that he was in the Mokattam Mountain a deck which is a tall rectangular seat known as the bench of judges and they used to go out to observe the crescent and the Fatimids had special matters related to Ramadan including that in the three days preceding the holy month the judges were with them Those who take refuge in the Gate of the Caliph the Witnesses and the followers wander around all the nightmares D they lose their brushes and architecture and they work to remove the shag and dust in them so that they are usable in this month I do not intend to talk about Ramadan celebrations before not until now but I want to pass on to our esteemed readers what I knew about the Ramadan cannon to announce the time of suhoor and then Constipation from food and the time of breaking the fast when the fasting people are blessed with the blessings that God has bestowed on them of their livelihoods History tells us that the custom of firing the Ramadan cannon started in Egypt at the end of the Mamluk era that is before Muhammad Ali assumed the mandate of Egypt in the year 5081 one of these governors bought a European cannon and wanted To try it and launch attempts took a long time and This happened on one of the days of Ramadan and the vulva did not come and the cannon set off only when the day signaled the end and the muezzins went up to the minarets to call on the ears of Morocco Although the matter was just a coincidence people thought that the governor wanted to warn them that the time for breakfast had come and then The firing of the cannon is usually proven at the time of breakfast and suhur and the current breakfast cannon that is launched in Egypt goes back to the days of Muhammad Ali Pasha the ruler of Egypt from 5081 to 1948 The first cannon was made in Germany and inscribed on it quotKrupp 9quot and Krupp was one of the largest weapons factories in Europe for a period Long in the Egyptian archives records that this cannon He participated in military battles before and when it was time for him to retire stay in his current location near Salah ElDin Castle and a thousand people on that day to watch the governor and rulers wearing official quothonorablequot clothes and head to the castle for special celebrations to attend the sighting of the crescent and celebrate the month of fasting which he was announcing For the people of this cannon and its successors after it and as long as we refer to the month of Ramadan which Muslims around the world bless let us mention something about its special dishes in Egypt the most famous of which is the fava beans dish the tarshi dish and the pickled municipalities and there are nuts that are served after breakfast and the custom took place in the popular neighborhoods so that customers do not buy Fava beans or thrash only an hour before breakfast or a little more than that believing that the dishes are ready fresh and I have witnessed a crowd of this kind on AlMosky Street in Cairo on a visit to me more than half a century ago and what I remember about that visit are pictures published in a magazine quotThe photographerquot for breakfast hosted by quotIslam Pashaquot for a group of friends and tableware of beans topped the magazine The magazine insisted on the day saying that Islam Pasha sent his private car to Mansoura north of Cairo at a great distance because he was a famous fan so he wanted his guests to enjoy his beans and wanted It is to mention the press with care to delight him Loyal friends When I visited Cairo in the middle of the year 2000 it was not the time for Ramadan but the city with a population of 31 million at night and about 61 million in the day and enjoying the noise of cars and their horns are deafening I dont think people care about hearing the Ramadan cannon that is still fired From the castle every evening or until the muezzins voice was poor the Ramadan cannon made the noise lose its joy and became screaming in the wilderness Abu Dhabi AlHayat an Emirati businessman donated half a million slingshots made by the Emirates and the load of 50 large trucks of stones from the mountains of the Emirates weighing more
