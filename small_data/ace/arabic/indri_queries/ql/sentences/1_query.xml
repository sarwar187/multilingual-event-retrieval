<text> Has the American singer Madonna set the date for her marriage with her son Rocco39s father according to Jewish rituals and symbols This is at least what the British press whose correspondents and delegates of the international press flock to northern Scotland claim to cover the wedding ceremony which will be the most prominent event in Britain during this period of the year in which hot and exciting events decline and it appears that the Catholic origin Madonna who chose for her first daughter the name Lord After the French town of Lourdes in which a famous religious shrine of the Virgin Mary called Lady of Lourdes is overwhelmed by the Jewish beliefs that she embraced and choosing to marry her on the 22nd of this month to coincide with the first day of the quotChanukahquot Jewish feasts The sevenday event which is held to celebrate the lights and the wedding will take place at Skibo Castle in the small town of Dornock in northern Scotland a day after Madonna baptized her fourmonthold son Rocco in the town39s cathedral where the Queen of Pop music is expected to participate in chanting chanting and proportions To the American singer that she entered into the atmosphere of Jewish mysticism and the teachings of Jewish midwifery since the birth of her daughter four years ago influenced by a group of her friends including singer Barbara Streisand and former supermodel Jerry Hall and the decision to perform a cesarean section to have her son Rocco appeared to be linked with Midwives who say that the child should be born on the first day of the lunar month at the birth of the crescent and for this she set a date in advance at the clinic where she went to undergo a cesarean section and the priestess Susan Brown will marry Madonna from her boyfriend British director Guy Ritchie in a ceremony that will be calm and free of appearances The pomp and limousine cars that Madonna prevented her guests from attending as well as the hats that Madonna banned as evidence of underdevelopment and Madonna does not want her party to be similar to her previous wedding in 1989 when journalists and television photographers surrounded her with helicopters a shelf And her fiancé lost offers by two British magazines to obtain an exclusive right to publish the wedding ceremony pictures for whatever price they wish and announced that they will publish after the wedding a free photo of everyone who wishes to see them marry and the Jewish mystical beliefs may affect the way Madonna thinks that rejects her Catholic religion despite her baptism Her son and her request for a Christian priestess to marry her except that the allegation of the British popular newspaper quotSunquot yesterday that Madonna wants a marriage of a Buddhist nature does nothing but confirm the frequent confusion raised by the blonde queen of pop in the British press</text>
