<text> Yesterday the court session that examined the Palestinian appeal Jawad AlButma and Samar AlAlami suspended the decision of their conviction for quotconspiring to causequot two explosions at the Israeli embassy and quotBalfour Housequot in London in July 1994 after their lawyer Michael Mansfield told the court that someone called the day before yesterday One of the members of the defense team lawyer Gareth Pearce provided her with information that could shed light on the embassy bombing Mansfield said that the person who called Pearce mentioned that the information was originally provided to the police and it is assumed that he did so before the two bombings in 1994 and Pearce maintains the name of the person who transmitted the information to a center The police and the names of the police officers who were given them and Mansfield said that the defense team intends to provide this information in a letter to the Public Prosecution Authority to verify whether it is registered and asked Mansfield to give the defense team some time to follow up on this new information as well as the information that was given to him the day before yesterday that the security apparatus The British MI5 had received a warning about the bombing and Mansfield wanted to also consult with George Jovi and Yazid Sayegh who were represented as defense experts during the trial of alButma and AlAlami in December 1996 and the Palestinians were sentenced to 20 years in prison after being convicted by a body Jurors Judge Rose who heads the threejudge court announced that in light of what Mansfield said the session should be suspended but he warned that the trial may not be resumed until several months later because the three judges have other obligations and the consideration of the appeal in the Supreme Court began Tuesday In the past the police had said during the trial in 1996 that there was an quotintelligence vacuumquot in the case while the judge announced at the end of the trial that a large number of questions remained unanswered but the defense team believes that there is a large amount of intelligence that can show that a decision Condemn the Lamy and alButma are not trusted and should be canceled by the Court of Appeal but the defense faces as the court sessions showed significant obstacles that prevent it from obtaining any of this information With the aim of helping the Palestinians in the occupied territories and mentioning that a Palestinian named Reda AlMughrabi is still unknown he fabricated against them the charge of conspiracy to carry out the bombing operations and the prosecution questioned whether the Moroccan was indeed present but the defense hopes that the new information will be consistent with the statements of alButmah and alAlam Y during the trial regarding AlMaghrabi39s presence and activities in London the defense team argues that the party that carried out the bombings was an organized group and perhaps related to the Iranian or Israeli government Judges Mansfield was briefed the day before yesterday on a summary of some of the information that was previously classified showed that the MI5 And the quotspecial branchquot of the London Police obtained before the bombing of the Israeli embassy evidence from a quotclientquot that a terrorist organization was seeking information about the embassy site in London and its protection arrangements but such information was not provided to that terrorist organization and did not carry out the bombings And she said to me SR after the suspension of the session yesterday They provided us with a small amount of information that does not provide any help at all We are exploring around us such as a blind man carrying a white stick which highlights the extent of the prejudice of procedural issues when they are all behind closed doors and pointed out that the Court of Appeal ignored the European Courts decision When I decided to examine confidential documents

were convicted on April 6 of endangering the lives of more than 200 people at risk by trying to prevent the landing of the plane coming from Sri Lanka including General Pervez Musharraf whom Sharif had sacked hours before the army command Western sources in Cairo confirmed that the investigations conducted by American investigators regarding the bombing of the American destroyer quotColequot in the port of Aden which killed 71 American sailors from the quotMarinesquot are heading towards condemning Osama bin Laden and the former leader of the Egyptian quotjihadquot group Dr Ayman alZawahiri who currently live in Afghanistan and others belonging to them residing in Yemen and AlHayat learned that investigators of the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI affiliated to the American Embassy in Cairo have started efforts to find information about the activities of Egyptian elements that were linked for a while to bin Laden and alZawahiri in Afghanistan and then they headed to Yemen and others still residing in Afghanistan turned out to have trained quotIslamic suicide bombersquot in preparing explosives and organizing suicide operations and the sources stated that among those who Americans seek to know about their history is the Egyptian chemical engineer Medhat Morsi who is known among the fundamentalists as quotAbu Khababquot who turned out to be from He went to the coastal province of Alexandria and got a Bachelor of Science from her university at the end of the seventies and he left Egypt in the eighties and toured several countries until he settled in Afghanistan where he worked as an expert in the field of explosives taking advantage of his academic experiences and cooperated with several fundamentalist organizations taken from Afghan lands throughout the eighties until the early nineties centers and sources added that Abu Khabab officially joined the midnineties to the quotAlQaedaquot organization founded by Osama bin Laden and quickly raised the organizational ladder as a result of his high efficiency in training the organization39s members until he became the third man in quotAlQaedaquot after Ibn Laden and his assistant Subaihi Abu Sitta known as Abu Hafs alMasri who is in command of the military action of the organization and the sources suggested that the perpetrators of the Aden operation were trained by Abu Khabab noting that the man undertook these tasks after the killing of the former military leader of alQaeda Ali alRashidi known as the father And Obaida AlTabashiri who died by drowning in an African lake in the midnineties and the sources confirmed that the initial indications of the investigations are heading towards not linking the bombing of the Cole and the explosion that took place at the British embassy in Sana39a on the second day as it was found that the embassy bombing was carried out in a primitive way from Throwing a bomb that caused it to fall on the electricity board inside the embassy added to the force of the detonation while the detonation of the destroyer was a carefully planned action according to a scheme similar to the bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998 Like the captain of a Greek ship and three of its sailors they were accused of manslaughter in the accident of the shipwreck last week They appeared today before a court just an hour after another ship

<text> Has the American singer Madonna set the date for her marriage with her son Rocco39s father according to Jewish rituals and symbols This is at least what the British press whose correspondents and delegates of the international press flock to northern Scotland claim to cover the wedding ceremony which will be the most prominent event in Britain during this period of the year in which hot and exciting events decline and it appears that the Catholic origin Madonna who chose for her first daughter the name Lord After the French town of Lourdes in which a famous religious shrine of the Virgin Mary called Lady of Lourdes is overwhelmed by the Jewish beliefs that she embraced and choosing to marry her on the 22nd of this month to coincide with the first day of the quotChanukahquot Jewish feasts The sevenday event which is held to celebrate the lights and the wedding will take place at Skibo Castle in the small town of Dornock in northern Scotland a day after Madonna baptized her fourmonthold son Rocco in the town39s cathedral where the Queen of Pop music is expected to participate in chanting chanting and proportions To the American singer that she entered into the atmosphere of Jewish mysticism and the teachings of Jewish midwifery since the birth of her daughter four years ago influenced by a group of her friends including singer Barbara Streisand and former supermodel Jerry Hall and the decision to perform a cesarean section to have her son Rocco appeared to be linked with Midwives who say that the child should be born on the first day of the lunar month at the birth of the crescent and for this she set a date in advance at the clinic where she went to undergo a cesarean section and the priestess Susan Brown will marry Madonna from her boyfriend British director Guy Ritchie in a ceremony that will be calm and free of appearances The pomp and limousine cars that Madonna prevented her guests from attending as well as the hats that Madonna banned as evidence of underdevelopment and Madonna does not want her party to be similar to her previous wedding in 1989 when journalists and television photographers surrounded her with helicopters a shelf And her fiancé lost offers by two British magazines to obtain an exclusive right to publish the wedding ceremony pictures for whatever price they wish and announced that they will publish after the wedding a free photo of everyone who wishes to see them marry and the Jewish mystical beliefs may affect the way Madonna thinks that rejects her Catholic religion despite her baptism Her son and her request for a Christian priestess to marry her except that the allegation of the British popular newspaper quotSunquot yesterday that Madonna wants a marriage of a Buddhist nature does nothing but confirm the frequent confusion raised by the blonde queen of pop in the British press</text>

<text>South Korea recently announced that it would not buy three Russian submarines confirming that this had nothing to do with the sinking of the Kursk submarine in August  It may be that the talk about seeing the crescent of Ramadan came late now and more than half of the blessed month has passed but with the abundance of what has been written about Ramadan affairs in this month of fasting there is still something that can be added and it is known that the first judge in Egypt went out with people to see the crescent Ramadan is the judge Ibn Lahiya AlMaqrizi the famous historian of Egypt narrated that he was in the Mokattam Mountain a deck which is a tall rectangular seat known as the bench of judges and they used to go out to observe the crescent and the Fatimids had special matters related to Ramadan including that in the three days preceding the holy month the judges were with them Those who take refuge in the Gate of the Caliph the Witnesses and the followers wander around all the nightmares D they lose their brushes and architecture and they work to remove the shag and dust in them so that they are usable in this month I do not intend to talk about Ramadan celebrations before not until now but I want to pass on to our esteemed readers what I knew about the Ramadan cannon to announce the time of suhoor and then Constipation from food and the time of breaking the fast when the fasting people are blessed with the blessings that God has bestowed on them of their livelihoods History tells us that the custom of firing the Ramadan cannon started in Egypt at the end of the Mamluk era that is before Muhammad Ali assumed the mandate of Egypt in the year 5081 one of these governors bought a European cannon and wanted To try it and launch attempts took a long time and This happened on one of the days of Ramadan and the vulva did not come and the cannon set off only when the day signaled the end and the muezzins went up to the minarets to call on the ears of Morocco Although the matter was just a coincidence people thought that the governor wanted to warn them that the time for breakfast had come and then The firing of the cannon is usually proven at the time of breakfast and suhur and the current breakfast cannon that is launched in Egypt goes back to the days of Muhammad Ali Pasha the ruler of Egypt from 5081 to 1948 The first cannon was made in Germany and inscribed on it quotKrupp 9quot and Krupp was one of the largest weapons factories in Europe for a period Long in the Egyptian archives records that this cannon He participated in military battles before and when it was time for him to retire stay in his current location near Salah ElDin Castle and a thousand people on that day to watch the governor and rulers wearing official quothonorablequot clothes and head to the castle for special celebrations to attend the sighting of the crescent and celebrate the month of fasting which he was announcing For the people of this cannon and its successors after it and as long as we refer to the month of Ramadan which Muslims around the world bless let us mention something about its special dishes in Egypt the most famous of which is the fava beans dish the tarshi dish and the pickled municipalities and there are nuts that are served after breakfast and the custom took place in the popular neighborhoods so that customers do not buy Fava beans or thrash only an hour before breakfast or a little more than that believing that the dishes are ready fresh and I have witnessed a crowd of this kind on AlMosky Street in Cairo on a visit to me more than half a century ago and what I remember about that visit are pictures published in a magazine quotThe photographerquot for breakfast hosted by quotIslam Pashaquot for a group of friends and tableware of beans topped the magazine The magazine insisted on the day saying that Islam Pasha sent his private car to Mansoura north of Cairo at a great distance because he was a famous fan so he wanted his guests to enjoy his beans and wanted It is to mention the press with care to delight him Loyal friends When I visited Cairo in the middle of the year 2000 it was not the time for Ramadan but the city with a population of 31 million at night and about 61 million in the day and enjoying the noise of cars and their horns are deafening I dont think people care about hearing the Ramadan cannon that is still fired From the castle every evening or until the muezzins voice was poor the Ramadan cannon made the noise lose its joy and became screaming in the wilderness Abu Dhabi AlHayat an Emirati businessman donated half a million slingshots made by the Emirates and the load of 50 large trucks of stones from the mountains of the Emirates weighing more
