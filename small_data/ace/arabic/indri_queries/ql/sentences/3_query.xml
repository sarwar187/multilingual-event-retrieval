<text> It may be that the talk about seeing the crescent of Ramadan came late now and more than half of the blessed month has passed but with the abundance of what has been written about Ramadan affairs in this month of fasting there is still something that can be added and it is known that the first judge in Egypt went out with people to see the crescent Ramadan is the judge Ibn Lahiya AlMaqrizi the famous historian of Egypt narrated that he was in the Mokattam Mountain a deck which is a tall rectangular seat known as the bench of judges and they used to go out to observe the crescent and the Fatimids had special matters related to Ramadan including that in the three days preceding the holy month the judges were with them Those who take refuge in the Gate of the Caliph the Witnesses and the followers wander around all the nightmares D they lose their brushes and architecture and they work to remove the shag and dust in them so that they are usable in this month I do not intend to talk about Ramadan celebrations before not until now but I want to pass on to our esteemed readers what I knew about the Ramadan cannon to announce the time of suhoor and then Constipation from food and the time of breaking the fast when the fasting people are blessed with the blessings that God has bestowed on them of their livelihoods History tells us that the custom of firing the Ramadan cannon started in Egypt at the end of the Mamluk era that is before Muhammad Ali assumed the mandate of Egypt in the year 5081 one of these governors bought a European cannon and wanted To try it and launch attempts took a long time and This happened on one of the days of Ramadan and the vulva did not come and the cannon set off only when the day signaled the end and the muezzins went up to the minarets to call on the ears of Morocco Although the matter was just a coincidence people thought that the governor wanted to warn them that the time for breakfast had come and then The firing of the cannon is usually proven at the time of breakfast and suhur and the current breakfast cannon that is launched in Egypt goes back to the days of Muhammad Ali Pasha the ruler of Egypt from 5081 to 1948 The first cannon was made in Germany and inscribed on it quotKrupp 9quot and Krupp was one of the largest weapons factories in Europe for a period Long in the Egyptian archives records that this cannon He participated in military battles before and when it was time for him to retire stay in his current location near Salah ElDin Castle and a thousand people on that day to watch the governor and rulers wearing official quothonorablequot clothes and head to the castle for special celebrations to attend the sighting of the crescent and celebrate the month of fasting which he was announcing For the people of this cannon and its successors after it and as long as we refer to the month of Ramadan which Muslims around the world bless let us mention something about its special dishes in Egypt the most famous of which is the fava beans dish the tarshi dish and the pickled municipalities and there are nuts that are served after breakfast and the custom took place in the popular neighborhoods so that customers do not buy Fava beans or thrash only an hour before breakfast or a little more than that believing that the dishes are ready fresh and I have witnessed a crowd of this kind on AlMosky Street in Cairo on a visit to me more than half a century ago and what I remember about that visit are pictures published in a magazine quotThe photographerquot for breakfast hosted by quotIslam Pashaquot for a group of friends and tableware of beans topped the magazine The magazine insisted on the day saying that Islam Pasha sent his private car to Mansoura north of Cairo at a great distance because he was a famous fan so he wanted his guests to enjoy his beans and wanted It is to mention the press with care to delight him Loyal friends When I visited Cairo in the middle of the year 2000 it was not the time for Ramadan but the city with a population of 31 million at night and about 61 million in the day and enjoying the noise of cars and their horns are deafening I dont think people care about hearing the Ramadan cannon that is still fired From the castle every evening or until the muezzins voice was poor the Ramadan cannon made the noise lose its joy and became screaming in the wilderness LONDON Reuters  The International Institute for Strategic Studies announced in London yesterday that the Middle East was the most heavily purchased region in the past year and the institute stated that military spending in the Middle East where tensions have risen this month due to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians reached  60 billion over the past year That is without any change from 1998 the institute said in an annual report entitled quotMilitary Balancequot that quotin the absence of a resolution of the tensions in the Middle East and North Africa the region remained the largest arms market in the worldquot and the report stated that the world39s arms trade declined slightly in the year Alma The value of sales was estimated at about  534 billion down from the previous year during which sales amounted to approximately  58 billion but military spending for the world39s governments during 1999 remained close to 1998 levels and reached  909 billion The report added that budgets Military available for the year 2000 does not show any reduction except in western Europe The report clarified that the armed forces of the United States and western European countries are deployed in several parts of the world due to obligations in the Balkans Africa and Asia after a period that witnessed a significant reduction in the military presence
