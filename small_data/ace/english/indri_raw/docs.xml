<TEXT>Even as the secretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert last month, a 30-foot Cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men landed on American shores, utterly undetected by the Coast Guard Secretary Ridge now leads.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>5</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He lost an election to a dead man.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>9</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones University.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's really important, like political consulting.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Paul, as I understand your definition of a political -- of a professional politician based on that is somebody who is elected to public office.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now in your administration, the Clinton administration, there were these members of the cabinet who by your definition were professional politicians -- Lloyd Bentsen, Les Aspin, William S. Cohen, Janet Reno, Bruce Babbitt, Mike Espy, Dan Glickman, Norman Mineta, Henry Cisneros, Federico Pena, Bill Richardson, Richard Riley, 12 of them, not to mention former Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, and one of the great professional politicians of all time, Bill Daly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And these bozos let four armed Cubans land on our shores when they're trying to make a high terrorist alert.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Our president has put homeland security in the hands of failed Republican hacks.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>16</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Hire professionals, Mr. President.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>17</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So it's OK -- it's OK to have professional politicians at the Justice Department and the Pentagon...</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>18</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Janet Reno was a career prosecutor.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>19</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Just a minute, let me finish my sentence, please.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>20</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's OK to put Democratic career politicians at the Pentagon and the Justice Department if they're Democrats but not if they're Republicans, is that right?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>21</DOCNO>
<TEXT>No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to run, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer was no.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>25</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut made the announcement today that he would not be the 10th candidate for the nomination.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>26</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Why not?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>27</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>28</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He explained he could better spend the next two years on homeland security, the economy and judicial nominations.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>29</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I guess that means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President Bush's plans to reform judiciary.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>43</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3 trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Senator Dale Bumpers has just published a memoir called "The Best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town."</TEXT>

<TEXT>And it spans his life from the depression era to the Clinton era.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>58</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Let's ask him which was more depressing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>59</DOCNO>
<TEXT>First, thank you for writing this book.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>60</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is extraordinary.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>61</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is wonderful.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>62</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And then we read you one passage.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>63</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You cite a session you had with President Lyndon Johnson in Austin, I guess, at his ranch, right?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>64</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Here is what you quote our President Johnson to you.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>65</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"When I was majority leader, and later president, I spent all my time pulling every power string I could find to pull, trying to pass bills that helped people.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>68</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"Republicans?</TEXT>

<DOCNO>69</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Republicans just stand for two things: protecting the rich and investigation Democrats."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>70</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's true, though, isn't it?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>71</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Johnson was right, wasn't he?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>72</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I thought that was one of the most prescient things I ever heard, and that was long before White Water.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Can I interrupt this Democratic picnic for just a minute?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>76</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, Senator, inadvertently, you gave support in this book to one of my pet political themes, which you probably don't agree with.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>77</DOCNO>
<TEXT>On page 256 you say, "As the years went by" -- this is when you were in the Senate -- "less and less information was new, fewer and fewer arguments were fresh, and the repetitiveness of the old arguments became tiresome."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>78</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"I was becoming almost as cynical as my constituents.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>79</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I knew it was time to leave."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>80</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Isn't that a great argument for term limits?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>81</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I know very few senators or any who are as good in their third term as they are in their first term.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>82</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Shouldn't we limit them to two terms?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>83</DOCNO>
<TEXT>First of all, that statement is not designed to cover everybody in the United States Senate.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>84</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I must say, that's a pretty accurate statement.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>85</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But it has nothing do with term limits, in my opinion.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>91</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This struck me because you've got the courage to say something that is heretical today and it's music to my ears.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>92</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You say, "Partisanship has taken on an odious connotation, and it may indeed be shriller now than ever.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>93</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we have two political parties so people will have choices.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>94</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If everybody agreed on everything, it might be a tranquil society, but it surely would be a dole one, and certainly not certainly a good one."</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>95</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, Paul, that's the reason we have two parties, so people have a choice.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>Senator Bumpers, of the 22 senators of the old confederacy, when I got to Washington with the Associated Press, 45 years ago, 22 of them were Democrats, nine were Republicans.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>98</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now 13 are Republicans and nine are Democrats.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>99</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And of the Democrats, I don't think there is a real liberal.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>100</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Your last year in the Senate I had an interview with you and I wrote a column called "The Last Southern Liberal."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>101</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I thank you.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>102</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was a very flattering article, Bob.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>103</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And you said, I'll quote it, you said, today's Southern voters are "children of Democrats who are not swayed by the same things their mothers and fathers were.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>104</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They certainly are susceptible to the Republican message."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>105</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's a good future for the Democratic Party in the South.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>106</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Bob, I think that the reason everybody in the south -- you know, first of all, we were -- when Franklin Roosevelt was elected president, we had been living what we thought was still a conquered nation after the Civil War.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>107</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And we felt that Franklin Roosevelt was the first person who ever really acknowledged that the South had peculiar problems.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>108</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And from that time on, that's the reason we had 22 Democratic senators from 11 confederate states, is because of the Civil War and because of what we thought was a heavy hand of the federal government all the time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>109</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Of course there was always that old story about the Yankees, and Yankees were synonymous with Republicans.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>110</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But that's all changed and memories have dimmed.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>111</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And people, you know, they don't remember that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>112</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And so the message, the Republicans have actually had a golden opportunity to make their case and they've done it successfully.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>113</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And the Democrats need desperately to get a message to counter that, and they need to get a message and stay on it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>114</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean we cannot be all over the lot.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>119</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They're not buying a new deal.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>120</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I'll tell you the message the Democrats ought to be -- that every time we get sort of within the grasp of the golden age, I mean within reach of the golden age, where everybody has health care, where everybody gets a good education -- you know I'm one of the million and a half people -- my brother went to Harvard, I went to Northwestern University.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>121</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Two schools my father couldn't have even thought about affording.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>122</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A million and a half veterans came out of War World II on the GI bill and got that kind of an education.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>123</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If that makes me a liberal, because I believe the government has a role to play in that, then I am a certified liberal, because I think that made the country stronger.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>124</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think certainly it made every one of those people stronger, and I think we ought to be doing it right now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Welcome back.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>193</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>194</DOCNO>
<TEXT>President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>195</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We're debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald Palmisano.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>196</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Dr. Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>197</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Let me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus on his own experience.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>198</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He was the governor of my state of Texas, where there are a whole lot of doctors.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>199</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It turns out that he didn't do any kind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>200</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Here's what the "Dallas Morning News" reported recently: "The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, the agency that pledges to protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>201</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>202</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It has refused in the last five years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical errors.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>203</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>204</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>205</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, first off...</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>206</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>207</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one, have adequate funding.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>208</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The AMA supports that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>209</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If there are any bad doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine.</TEXT>

<DOC>

<TEXT>... bad doctors?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>213</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>214</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because someone pays money in a case, the insurance company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>215</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Troy Brennan (ph) of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only with disability.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>216</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>217</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Actually, Troy Brennan, the same doctor at Harvard Public School of Health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits, it's too many.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>218</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Less than 10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice, and we're talking about horrific injuries here, even file a claim.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>219</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Even file a claim.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>220</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>221</DOCNO>
<TEXT>On dog food.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>222</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>223</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's a fraction of physician income.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>224</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>226</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's what the people in Congress have to do.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>227</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>439</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The foreign ministers of France, Germany and Russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second American-backed resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>440</DOCNO>
<TEXT>President Bush wants the Security Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq, and his press secretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just what he'll get.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>441</DOCNO>
<TEXT>President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sitting Security Council member, the African nation of Guinea, because he said -- quote -- "I used to have one of their pigs."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>442</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So -- OK, I made that up.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>He didn't say that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>444</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>454</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It doesn't mean we have to go to war.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>455</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and backing them up with the threat of force.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely to stop disarming Saddam Hussein.</TEXT>

</DOC>

<TEXT>Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament -- quote -- "too little, too late" gestures, meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>462</DOCNO>
<TEXT>U.S. intelligence said Powell indicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, even as it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimed not to have.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>463</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Powell also revealed that Iraq is hiding chemical and biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around Baghdad.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>464</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In order to secure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confront Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm -- quote -- "here and now."</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>479</DOCNO>

<TEXT>Well, those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this: MSNBC, an obscure cable channel, has fired Phil Donahue, the host of its highest-rated show.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>492</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A memo from inside NBC, reported on the Web site allyourtv.com, and today in "The Washington Post," shows NBC big wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo -- quote -- "a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war, while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>493</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So there it is, according to NBC.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>494</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Phil Donahue was fired because he's a liberal.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>495</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In fact, the only liberal with the solo cable talk show.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>553</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We're talking with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat and his fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>554</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Mr. King, thanks for stying with us through the break.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>555</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One of the reasons that we like having you on, and as well as Mr. Rangel, is that, you know, this is war, as we were saying in the last segment.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>556</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserves.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>557</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And you're a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>558</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So I wonder if you'll join Charlie Rangel, who put out a press release today, decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>559</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Isn't that wrong in a time of war?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>560</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The important thing is that the bill pass for the military.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>561</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the other stuff's in there, it's there.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>562</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean to me, the main purpose should be the military.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>563</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm not going to disagree with Charlie's point.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>564</DOCNO>
<TEXT>On the other hand, often when bills are passed, there are things attached to them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>565</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So to me, the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the military and that's what we should do.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Congressman Rangel, a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said -- made the charge that we are, quote, "we haven't made any real progress in the war against al Qaeda."</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hi, Judy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>796</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>797</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Four U.S. soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division manning a checkpoint near the town of Najaf killed today in an apparent suicide bombing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>798</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A man driving what appeared to be a taxicab came to the checkpoint, waved soldiers over, appeared to be having mechanical problems of some kind.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>799</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As the soldiers approached, the man detonated explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>800</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is something that Iraqi Vice President Ramadan had said would take place.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>801</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He said this long before the conflict ever began.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>802</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He reiterated today in a press conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on killing thousands of U.S. troops with suicide bombing similar to this.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>803</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also, in southern Iraq today near Basra, two members - claimed to be members of Saddam's Thataeen (ph) group surrendered to U.S. troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings down there but that they didn't want to die for the regime so they were surrendering.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>804</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal said that it looked a lot like terrorism.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>805</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strict adherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures to ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>806</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So it won't change our overall rules of engagement.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>807</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It doesn't effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>808</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>811</DOCNO>
<TEXT>No injuries reported.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>812</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The missiles are programmed so that they don't detonate until they reach their target.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>813</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If they go astray, then the warheads never arm but claiming that it's about one percent of the warheads.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>814</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They've fired 675 or so tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Chris, very quickly, new information from the Pentagon today about any concerns they have about Saddam Hussein's ongoing air defense capability?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>817</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, no major concern.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>818</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>819</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The reason that they're still in tact according to today's briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they don't turn them on, the U.S. has trouble locating them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>820</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They assure us that as soon as they do start turning on these radars that they'll take those out too and finish the job in terms of airspace over Baghdad.Judy ...</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>853</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>854</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean we're seeing one of the great advantages of U.S. and British forces now, Judy, which is that they're superbly trained troops.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>855</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they're adapting.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>856</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>857</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it, risks to the supply line, risks in terms of not clearing cities and they're shifting.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>858</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They're changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>859</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You've seen U.S. Central Command bringing up additional forces like the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines, get control over the cities and so I think that U.S. and British forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>860</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So as an onlooker, as somebody who's studied the Iraqi capabilities, is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>861</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Absolutely.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>862</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One of the things I think we're likely to see is that the Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U.S. forces are.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>863</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Typically what you've seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>864</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It doesn't come from the ground up.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>865</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You don't have ground commanders calling back and saying hey, we'd like to try this tactic or this seems to work.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>866</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Tell everybody else to do the same thing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>867</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Instead the high command has to identify a problem, come up with a solution and transmit it down.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>868</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Chances are the Iraqis are going to continue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blending in with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of these suicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>869</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There's no way around that but U.S. forces, British forces are beginning to adapt to it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>870</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting more support from ordinary Iraqi people.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>871</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I just interviewed a gentleman, native of Iraq, who talks to his family there all the time and he says they live in Baghdad 20, 30, 50 of them and he said they do the view the Americans as invaders.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>872</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They hate Saddam Hussein.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>873</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>874</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>875</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a grip on for years, exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do, they despise.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>876</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token, they don't like another country coming into their country to overturn the government and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for most Iraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the United States.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>877</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They remember that the United States betrayed them in 1991.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>The U.S. didn't finish Saddam then.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>879</DOCNO>
<TEXT>President Bush - then President Bush called on them to rise up and then the U.S. did nothing and so they're deeply suspicious of what we have in mind.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Which raises questions going forward.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>881</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One last thing, Ken Pollack I want to ask about this British officials saying that they have information that Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>882</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What's the significance of that?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>883</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>884</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>898</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, basically on the ridge itself it is the most forward Iraqi army positions and we've been watching them very closely for the last month prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are the positions that control this entire valley.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In addition to that, we know that further back behind those lines in the direction of Mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well, this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who have been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in smuggling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A few moments ago, out on the horizon, not very far ahead of the U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, we heard more than a few explosions.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry has compiled a rather extraordinary record in the past several days.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>1082</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was the first unit to cross the Euphrates River and then punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't seen for awhile.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1194</DOCNO>
<TEXT>First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN, the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S. troops, that taking place in Najaf.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1195</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S. troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1196</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They met lighter than expected resistance.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1197</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close in on Baghdad, this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>1200</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, in regard to that, we are paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1201</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They may just suddenly be effective on the ground.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1202</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Additionally, their ability to use chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1203</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We believe they have the capability now.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>Clearly, as we threaten the core of the regime, which Baghdad and Tikrit represent, we believe that the likelihood of them using those weapons goes up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>1259</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Thank you very much, Judy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1260</DOCNO>
<TEXT>To help guide us through all this discussion about red zones, and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the Republican Guard, we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1261</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He's retired with the United States Army.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1262</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency, among other things.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1263</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Colonel, good to have you with us.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1264</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You're welcome.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1265</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1266</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U.S. and coalition supply lines?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1267</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Or both?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1268</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food, fuel and ammunition.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1269</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1270</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Once they are satisfied they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad, probing hard to see how much resistance there really is.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1271</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, let me ask you that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1272</DOCNO>
<TEXT>First of all, I just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1273</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is that Karbala area which is about 50 miles from Baghdad.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1274</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Baghdad is roughly in that direction from there.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1275</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1276</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One of the next key points along the way here is Saddam international airport.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1277</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Do you suppose that is a key target right now?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1278</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Oh, I'm sure it is.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1279</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you'd want to hold.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1280</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And besides, as soon as you get control of it you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a survey team in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it for helicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1281</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad, they'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1282</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now, as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there are some big, wide divided highways there.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1283</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Control of these highways will be crucial won't it?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1284</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approaches.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1285</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They will try to go down those things, cutting the city up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1286</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I would think, probably, various facilities as well as major government buildings that they need to control to set up a new government.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1287</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's a big city, about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1288</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Some have said Chicago is a good analogy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1289</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source, or am a wrong?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1290</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1291</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can control them with a fairly small force.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1292</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If, in fact, a lot of people in the city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1293</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1294</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Shias are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in 1991.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>1295</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They rose up, didn't get American support.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>1296</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1297</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1298</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1299</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They have a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1300</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And they don't have any particular reason to trust us, so far.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1301</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So they'll wait and see what happens.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1302</DOCNO>

<TEXT>Good afternoon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We appreciate y'all coming out for what you're doing for Jessie and all of the other troops that are missing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1467</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We've been waiting all day word from the doctors, and they have successively done one surgery on her.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1468</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There will be other surgeries to do that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1469</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's going to take time and patience.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1470</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But she's great and she's doing good.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1471</DOCNO>
<TEXT>She's in real good spirits.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1472</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We talked to her.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1473</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We talked to her before the surgery, we talked to her after the surgery, and she's doing good.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1474</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Can't you think?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1475</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yes, a bunch, but my mind's blank.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1476</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The doctor has completed one surgery on her back.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1477</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They have released the pressure on a nerve, and realigned all the disks and put plates and stuff in it, and that was because she didn't have any feeling in her feet.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1478</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So he, he's pretty sure right now that that will relieve, relieve the tension, and her feet will be able to move.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1479</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also, we have heard and seen reports that she had multiple gunshot wounds, and knife stabbing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1480</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The doctor has not seen any of this.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1481</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He looked for the gunshot wounds for the knife stabbing, and there is no injury whatsoever.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1482</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They will do surgery again tomorrow on her legs.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1483</DOCNO>
<TEXT>She has fractured legs and her right forearm.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1484</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And we are just waiting to get that good news too.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1485</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We talked to her before and after the surgery, like I said, and she's just, she just sounded real good.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1486</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Of course, this morning she was a little groggy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1487</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But yet, she was good, because it was early.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1488</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And then this afternoon, after the surgery, she was our Jessie again.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1489</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If those weren't gunshot wounds to cause the broken bones, do they know what caused the fractures?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1490</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They have no idea at this time what caused them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1491</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We know she's in good spirits, because they told her they was gonna put pink casts on her legs and arms, and she had pink casts when she was in the third grade on her arm so we know she -- her mind is working good.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1492</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So she's in good spirits, and we hope the surgery will go good tomorrow, just as well as it did today.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not in any way.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>Those tanks have 120-millimeter smoothbore gun on them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment, and that is why movement through an urban area is very, very dangerous.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1584</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's the side that's moving that's going to take the casualties.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1585</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That said, the armored fighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they're moving a little bit faster as than we probably will.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>1586</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We'll use patience and finesse.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1587</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We will take the time to locate the enemy, surround the blocks and the buildings that he is in.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1588</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And then we'll probably surge fires into their both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to make him move rather than us moving through the assault zone.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1597</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In this case, slightly off target here because you see them all going in the front door.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1598</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Typically, when they'd assault a target like this, they'd do what?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1599</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, typically, if they do go in, which is generally the option of last resort, but if we do have to go in, often we'll try to go in from the top of the building down.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>1600</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot in clearing buildings, and grenades ten to offend downhill rather than uphill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, Laith Kubba is an Iraqi exile who has family members in Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2277</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Mr. Kubba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the National Endowment for Democracy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2278</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He is also the president of a group of Iraqi exiles, a group called the Iraq National Group.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2279</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He joins us now from London to talk about rebuilding his country.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2280</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Mr. Kubba, first of all, your thoughts as you've watched these scenes of Baghdad, the Saddam Hussein regime falling in the last day?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2281</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is a huge sigh of relief, because it could have been much worse and Baghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2282</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And, obviously, there are four million people who could have suffered more.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2283</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2284</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But, obviously, there is a great, great concern about the scenes that you've been showing on television.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2285</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Are you talking to family members now in Baghdad and around Iraq?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2286</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And, if you are, how concerned are they about the lawlessness?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2287</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, not in the recent three or four days.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2288</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There are no phone lines to Baghdad.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2289</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In other parts of Iraq, I received with great sadness the killing of one close colleague, Saeed Abu Naji Abhuey (ph) in Najaf.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2290</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He was not killed by former members of the Baath Party or the security of the army, but by just a local organized group.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2291</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So those signs to me are worrying.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2292</DOCNO>
<TEXT>People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the power vacuum and are testing it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2293</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And the more they test, the more I think they are claiming.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2294</DOCNO>
<TEXT>How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraq after this transition period, however long it is, where the U.S. is in charge?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2295</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, one needs to break down this process into various elements.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2296</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Today, there should be an authority.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2297</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And it's very likely that the U.S. and the British forces are the authority on land.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2298</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And there ought to be administration.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2299</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2300</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But when it comes to government, I think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2301</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But we need to do it quickly, because every day passes by with this vacuum, it's going to spell trouble.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2302</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, we know, Mr. Kubba, there are several Iraqi exiles groups competing for influence.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2303</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Is one of them going to have an advantage?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2304</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And, particularly, I have in mind the Iraqi National Congress that Mr. Chalabi, who was assisted by U.S. forces in getting back into Iraq?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2305</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think it's one thing to gain fame and access to Washington.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2306</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2307</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in Washington.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2308</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It must really be drawn on the ground inside Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2309</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And there are 22 million people there.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2310</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's not a void.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2311</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's not a vacuum.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2312</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I think all plans must be anchored there in Iraq in its reality.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2313</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So does one group have an advantage over another now?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2314</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There are different groups who have advantage over others in different parts of the country.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2315</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Unfortunately, we do not have a national group that can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice.This needs to be constructed, maybe through a conference to be held in Baghdad, where representatives from provinces all over Iraq need to participate, as well as political groups.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2316</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But we do not have a single group, a single leadership or a single council yet.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>We're talking with Laith Kubba, who is the president of a group of Iraqi exiles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What happened is that the Iraqi army up until now has not confronted the United States forces.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I think that he had a very, very difficult task.</TEXT>

<TEXT>He defended the positions of his country with courage, I would say.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>2469</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Welcome back to LATE EDITION.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2470</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We return now to my interview earlier today with the United States defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2471</DOCNO>
<TEXT>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2472</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I know during the war, before the war, you were very concerned about the position of the Syrian government, cooperating with Iraqis, having an open border, if you will.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2473</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Has the situation improved, especially in the aftermath now of the secretary of state's meeting with Bashar al-Asad?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2474</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, I guess time will tell.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2475</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I talked to Secretary Powell this morning on the phone a bit, and it's not, I think you need to let the dust settle on that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2476</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He's, in my judgment, had a visit that was worth doing, and the president asked him to do it, and it was the right thing to do.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2477</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We'll see what progress comes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2478</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, words are one thing, actions are another.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2479</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But right now you're open-minded as far as Syria on whether they will crack down on terrorism, take some of the other steps that you want them to take?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2480</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I know what they've been doing, and it's been unhelpful.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2481</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I know that Secretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful, and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2482</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In my view, they were making some unwise decisions previously.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2483</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What they'll do after this visit remains to be seen.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2484</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The secretary of state has written you a letter expressing, apparently, some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be spending, those detained at the U.S.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2485</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, about 600 or so of them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2486</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Is there any movement in trying to determine the fate of these individuals?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2487</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I don't think that's quite accurate as to what he wrote me about.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2488</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All right, tell me what...</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2489</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter-agency process, where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIA and DIA, and what have you, involved in interrogating these detainees, it takes time to find out what intelligence they have.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2490</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate, and what Colin and I have been concerned about, both of us, is that it's taking so long.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2491</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There are a number of countries, and the Department of State has the responsibility of dealing with those countries, that have foreign nationals in Gitmo, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, being detained, and those countries, understandably, would like to know when they could have those people.So the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2492</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Colin and I are trying to speed up that process, and that's what that's all about.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2493</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Let me just, a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2494</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Victory parades for the troops.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2495</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I remember covering General Schwarzkopf, the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2496</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Do you want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back, to have parades in New York, Washington, elsewhere?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2497</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and there will be.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2498</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world, and indeed for the Iraqi people, who have been liberated.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2499</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What's the best way to do that?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2500</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In the case of 1991, the task was to go in and get them out of Kuwait, and they did it, and they were properly greeted coming back to the United States.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2501</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In this instance, it was a very different task.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2502</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was to remove that regime, and it's part of a global war on terrorism that is not over.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2503</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist, that work with those global networks.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2504</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And on the one hand we will, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women, and we'll do it well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2505</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2506</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I kind of doubt it, because it's such a different circumstance.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2507</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Certainly, our war plan was not modeled off of 1991.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2508</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One final question on North Korea.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2509</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the North Koreans pursue their nuclear weapons ambitions...</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2510</DOCNO>
<TEXT>... a preemptive strike, is that something that is out there?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2511</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm not one who speculates about things like that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2512</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I know that back in the 1990s, in the Clinton administration, Secretary Perry called in the former secretaries of defense, and we had a discussion, and they clearly had teed up a military option that they were considering, and they then at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that that was not appropriate.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But those are very serious issues, and I leave them for the president.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2516</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Welcome back to LATE EDITION.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2517</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Joining us now are two key members of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2518</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In his home state of Indiana, the committee's chairman, Republican Senator Richard Lugar.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And here in Washington, Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Senators, welcome back to LATE EDITION.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Mr. Chairman, let me begin with you.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2522</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that, when all the dust settles, the U.S. may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2523</DOCNO>
<TEXT>No, I concur with Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, the president, that weapons of mass destruction are there, and likewise, that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2524</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and, likewise, the intellectual capital that is there to produce more.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2525</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because not much else is -- you don't need much to get it going again.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2526</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And that, I think, we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they don't re-enter the business, much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn-Lugar program.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2527</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What about you, Senator Dodd, do you believe, in the end, they will find weapons of mass destruction?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2528</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I have no evidence to the contrary.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2529</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And certainly, they have used them in the past.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2530</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There's no doubt about that at all, both in Iran and against the Kurdish population.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2531</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some got out of the country.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2532</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It wouldn't surprise me to hear that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2533</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I'm going to work on the assumption, based on the intelligence that has been gathered, that the weapons of mass destruction existed.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2534</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What if they don't?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2535</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, you know, they've used it in the past, and I think the point that Senator Lugar just made -- certainly having the intellectual capacity to do this was proven already by the fact they've used them in the past.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2536</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, I wouldn't dwell on that point specifically, because Saddam Hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2537</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity, and the world is a safer place today because he's not ruling Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2538</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Will the U.S. lose creditability, Mr. Chairman, if, if the U.S. finds no hard evidence, no so-called smoking gun?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2539</DOCNO>
<TEXT>No, we have full credibility in Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2540</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We've prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the Iraqi people, and we have clearly caused Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction, or at least to suppress evidence of them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2541</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that's important.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2542</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's important in the war against terrorism that we rout out whatever is there and, likewise, the people involved, because they might help supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2543</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Senator Dodd, how important is it for the U.S. to conclusively learn what happened to Saddam Hussein?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2544</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, it's important.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2545</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I don't think it's as important as finding Osama bin Laden, for the simple reason that I don't think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat, wherever he is.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2546</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If he is alive, obviously, he doesn't pose the kind of threat that an Osama bin Laden does with his cellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda and international terrorism.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2547</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, it would certainly be good to know where he is.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2548</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It would be, certainly, to know, to apprehend him, to bring him before a court of justice.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2549</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I don't think it's absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find out what happened to him.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2550</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And you agree with that assessment, Mr. Chairman?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2551</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yes, I think that Senator Dodd is right on.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2552</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Interview With Donald Rumsfeld; Lugar, Dodd Talk About Post-War Iraq;  Kissinger, Cohen Discuss Middle East Road Map</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2553</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What about the length of the U.S. military presence in Iraq, Senator Lugar?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2554</DOCNO>
<TEXT>How long do you anticipate large numbers of U.S. troops will remain there?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2555</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, I was heartened by what Secretary Rumsfeld told you in the last interview, that we will have troops there as long as necessary, but no longer than necessary.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2556</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think that's a pretty good way to state it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2557</DOCNO>
<TEXT>My own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2558</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We are trying to pass that on to others.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2559</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Likewise, the other government's procedures, the fledgling beginnings on democracy, and all the rest.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2560</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But that's going to require an undergirding.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2561</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now, in due course, as everybody points out, we may get help from other countries.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2562</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We may bring in NATO allies or the United Nations or other people in the Arab world.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2563</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That would be helpful.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2564</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But for the moment, this is our responsibility.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2565</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And we ought not to be having large debates about how rapidly we move out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2566</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I was upset, in a way, to hear reports that by the fall, three divisions out of five would be gone.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2567</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think Secretary Rumsfeld disabused us of that today.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2568</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And what about you, Senator Dodd, not only the length of time, but the cost to U.S. taxpayers?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2569</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Have you been given any ballpark estimate what this is going to cost the United States?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2570</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, what we've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $100 billion.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2571</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We put $2.5 billion in, in the last supplemental appropriations bill.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2572</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So it's going to be costly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2573</DOCNO>
<TEXT>These RFPs, these seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly, and so it's going to be expensive.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2574</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally on the United States.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2575</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now, I would hope that sooner rather than later we could see a civilian government emerge in Iraq, a democratically elected one, that there'd be more cooperation from the international community, on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuring that's necessary in Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2576</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And to the extent we can move that along more quickly, I think we're all going to be better off.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2577</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Being the sole, or almost the sole power there, both in terms of reconstruction and politically, exposes us to great vulnerabilities.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2578</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Senator Lugar, we have to take a quick break, but before we do, I wanted to just ask you, the U.N. role -- you say there could be a U.N. role.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2579</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Do you specifically want the United Nations to have some sort of peacekeeping role there?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2580</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And secondarily, what about countries like France, Germany, and Russia, which opposed the Bush administration's war plans, do you want them shut out?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2581</DOCNO>
<TEXT>No, I don't want anybody shut out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2582</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I do hope the United Nations will play a vital role in Iraq, whether it be in peacekeeping or various other ways, and I hope that that will occur soon.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2583</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think we really need an internationalization of the process, for the very reasons that Senator Dodd pointed out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2584</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2585</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We're going to take that quick break.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>2586</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Stand by, Senators.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>3681</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3682</DOCNO>
<TEXT>a family of four with an income of $40,000 would receive a 96% reduction in federal income taxes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3683</DOCNO>
<TEXT>instead of paying $1,178 per year, the family would pay $45 a year.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3684</DOCNO>
<TEXT>[ applause ] that means extra money in the family budget year after year.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3685</DOCNO>
<TEXT>that money can cover a lot of bills.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3686</DOCNO>
<TEXT>that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3687</DOCNO>
<TEXT>that money will be in circulation, which will be good for our economy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3688</DOCNO>
<TEXT>[ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3689</DOCNO>
<TEXT>the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and, as importantly, from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3690</DOCNO>
<TEXT>it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3691</DOCNO>
<TEXT>most small businesses are sole proprietorships, limited partnerships, are subchapter ss, and, therefore, when you reduce individual tax rates, you benefit small business formation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3692</DOCNO>
<TEXT>as a matter of fact, under this plan, some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3693</DOCNO>
<TEXT>which leaves more money for investment, more money for growth, more money for job creation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3694</DOCNO>
<TEXT>a growing economy also needs small business investment.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3695</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and our tax code should encourage investment.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3696</DOCNO>
<TEXT>today a small business can deduct a maximum of $25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3697</DOCNO>
<TEXT>we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3698</DOCNO>
<TEXT>[ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increased to $75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3699</DOCNO>
<TEXT>by doing so, we promote greater investment in machinery.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3700</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3701</DOCNO>
<TEXT>more investment equals jobs.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3702</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3703</DOCNO>
<TEXT>[ applause ] we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3704</DOCNO>
<TEXT>[ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3705</DOCNO>
<TEXT>it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3706</DOCNO>
<TEXT>the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3707</DOCNO>
<TEXT>falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3708</DOCNO>
<TEXT>removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>3714</DOCNO>
<TEXT>which has caused our government to run a deficit.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3715</DOCNO>
<TEXT>the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy, which means more revenues to our treasury, and less spending in washington, d.c. [ applause ] i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3716</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3760</DOCNO>
<TEXT>reporter: and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link, there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3761</DOCNO>
<TEXT>now this case is also taking on a rather, we should say, almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they're going to bring in an expert on what's called alufating decay, and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3762</DOCNO>
<TEXT>this is in the damage aspect of it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3763</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and they say these experts will be able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the remains of the almost full-term baby boy were inside the female's remains at the time of death.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3764</DOCNO>
<TEXT>also, the coroner could know right now but is not saying if there was some sort of trauma to either of these skeletons, for example, if they could see the bone compromised in some way they could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>3769</DOCNO>
<TEXT>reporter: it sounds like all of this will be too quick, and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>4925</DOCNO>

<TEXT>let's talk a little bit more about what the navy does to prevent such tragedies.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4940</DOCNO>
<TEXT>we were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4941</DOCNO>
<TEXT>i'll try to explain it the best i can from what i remember from being on the "uss abraham lincoln" this is an amphibious ship, rather, but this is what the navy does with regard to prevention.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4942</DOCNO>
<TEXT>everybody that is, every sailor that's entersing the navy does take a swim test.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4943</DOCNO>
<TEXT>they learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4944</DOCNO>
<TEXT>also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship, before any deployment, usually twice a day, they're practicing man overboard drills, knowing where to go, where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins, those wane off, but they know where to go quickly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4945</DOCNO>
<TEXT>they also wear float coats.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>4948</DOCNO>
<TEXT>everything is color coordinated.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4949</DOCNO>
<TEXT>you see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4950</DOCNO>
<TEXT>they also have a manual device so if the toggles don't work they can blow air into the inflation device.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4951</DOCNO>
<TEXT>they have dive goggles and they're able to find them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4952</DOCNO>
<TEXT>it also has a strobe light and a whistle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4953</DOCNO>
<TEXT>also such location devices, some ship have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to find or locate, let the rescuer locate them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4954</DOCNO>
<TEXT>also 24/7 there are individuals on watch.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4955</DOCNO>
<TEXT>all throughout the ship, all around the ship.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4956</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and indeed, there is netting on most parts of the ship, not on entire all around the entire ship, but on most parts there is a very thick netting.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4957</DOCNO>
<TEXT>now let's talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4958</DOCNO>
<TEXT>you will hear a p.a.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4959</DOCNO>
<TEXT>announcement around the entire ship.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4960</DOCNO>
<TEXT>there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4961</DOCNO>
<TEXT>a ship-wide search will happen f. they don't see that person go overboard, but if indeed they do see someone go overboard, the ship starts to circle that area continuously.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4962</DOCNO>
<TEXT>also small boats sometimes go out into the water, but even more importantly, helicopters are launched immediately.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4963</DOCNO>
<TEXT>inside those helicopters rescue imswimmers.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4964</DOCNO>
<TEXT>if indeed the man overboard is located, well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4965</DOCNO>
<TEXT>if the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket, but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4966</DOCNO>
<TEXT>the search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4967</DOCNO>
<TEXT>why call it off?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4968</DOCNO>
<TEXT>there's a number of reasons to look at.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4969</DOCNO>
<TEXT>depending on the water temperature, it's very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>4970</DOCNO>
<TEXT>also the reason for the 24-hour search is they fail they've exhausted all resources by that time.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>good to see you, jeff.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6135</DOCNO>
<TEXT>thank you.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6136</DOCNO>
<TEXT>it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6137</DOCNO>
<TEXT>so what's the difficulty in being able to go to mars?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6138</DOCNO>
<TEXT>it's unimaginably difficult and different.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6139</DOCNO>
<TEXT>mars is at most times 100 million miles away from us.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6140</DOCNO>
<TEXT>it's a nine-month trip.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6141</DOCNO>
<TEXT>then if we stay there for about a year or two, the whole trip could last about three years.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6142</DOCNO>
<TEXT>we're talking about conditions where there's radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6143</DOCNO>
<TEXT>the communications conditions once you're on mars, just to talk to people on earth, there's a 20 minute delay in the conversation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6144</DOCNO>
<TEXT>so the -- you know, the issues are so much larger than going to the moon.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6145</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and for now, it's 250 days, which seems to be the maximum for astronauts in space anyway.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6146</DOCNO>
<TEXT>but as you say, it's a much further travel.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6147</DOCNO>
<TEXT>but let's talk about some of the hurdles that hamper humans to be able to survive there.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6148</DOCNO>
<TEXT>the dust, for one thing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6149</DOCNO>
<TEXT>cataracts another.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6150</DOCNO>
<TEXT>let's talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans to actually get that far and to survive.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6151</DOCNO>
<TEXT>right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6152</DOCNO>
<TEXT>well, first of all, the spacecraft would not be launched from earth.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6153</DOCNO>
<TEXT>you'd have to launch is from in space already, which means we would have to build it in space.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6154</DOCNO>
<TEXT>so that means we need a good shuttle that's going to take us back and forth to build the spacecraft.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6155</DOCNO>
<TEXT>then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth's orbit all the way to mars.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6156</DOCNO>
<TEXT>that's probably going to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we haven't really developed yet, because we couldn't carry that much fuel, obviously.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6157</DOCNO>
<TEXT>liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mars.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6158</DOCNO>
<TEXT>the bigger issue is once we get there, we can't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three years, so we're going to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6159</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and think of it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6160</DOCNO>
<TEXT>mars is carbon dioxide.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6161</DOCNO>
<TEXT>so we can't breathe there.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6162</DOCNO>
<TEXT>so we're going to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water, to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the planet itself.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6163</DOCNO>
<TEXT>all of this is in the works now, but i think it's going to take quite a few years to develop it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6164</DOCNO>
<TEXT>you talk about the cosmic radiation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6165</DOCNO>
<TEXT>then of course there is the zero g bone loss, almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6166</DOCNO>
<TEXT>absolutely.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6167</DOCNO>
<TEXT>there could be as much as 50% bone loss in astronauts in mars.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6168</DOCNO>
<TEXT>during the time in mars.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6169</DOCNO>
<TEXT>because when the body has -- when there is no dpravity as there is on mars, the body doesn't pick up the calcium in the bones, so it doesn't keep getting the bones stronger and stronger.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6170</DOCNO>
<TEXT>so they will just lose it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6171</DOCNO>
<TEXT>they will be almost like old people even at the age of 40.</TEXT>

<TEXT>of course, according to the guardian, she's very worried about that, too, and she has warned the court that she hopes the mother will be placed in a better home when all of this is over, one where she is far better protected than she was by the state in a home where police say she was raped.</TEXT>

</DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6357</DOCNO>

<DOCNO>6936</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6937</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And, you know,  and I have a company, as well, set up.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6938</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think we have the account manager, and we have -- the vice president.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6939</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We have super- team lead- team leads, uh I and then have operations specialist.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6940</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We have, you know, I -- team managers, training managers.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6941</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's a very big company.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6942</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, and I think that the atmosphere is very good, I</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6943</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6944</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, I think that's important to to have a good atmosphere and also, uh,  uh, i- know who who really is in charge,  uh, you know, and and know who you have to answer to.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6945</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because sometimes, y- I I I did I years ago I had a company that was, uh,  it was,  uh, I was a subs- s- captive sub-contractor for making packaging material.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6946</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And, um,  there were a lot of salesmen in the company,  they had a tendency to,  you know, there was there was, uh, a chain of command, you might say.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6947</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, there was, uh, the person that was the, uh,  head of the organization.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6948</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But, all the salesmen -- used to come around and give orders, too, you know.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6949</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So it made it kind of difficult for the m- for my employees, because they would the salesmen would be coming out, uh,  uh, without consulting with the one that was in charge.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6950</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They would just be coming out and giving orders when they should already went through him.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6951</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So it made it difficult.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6952</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So I I I think it's really important to h- have that really clear.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6953</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That that there's some organized way to deal with, uh,  problems and orders and things like that, and if there is a problem, then -- you go to the person who's in charge and -- then they can handle it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6954</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, that was -- that that's just a you know, a -- previous, uh,  type of work that I had.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6955</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I and tha- I think that's what they wanted us to talk about, too, right?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6956</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, that's that's that's I think it's just basically, is (()) one of the things I perceive is if- what kind of, you know, environment is it, and is it inviting is it, you know, all that they I guess that's what they're aiming at.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6957</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, it's not a place where everybody trying to give instruction and everybody trying to do, you know.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6958</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh, but I for my job is i- i- -- we have us a very diverse feel.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6959</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We have a lot of people who are from different country, and,  you know, and -- I think they are pretty much accepting, and I,  you know, I- bas- basically you- you can promote yourself if you do a good job, I mean,  they don't pick and choose, you know.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6960</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6961</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's a very -- environment that allows you to grow in.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6962</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I think they thinks I rightfully don't, if -- like if I have a problem, like,  I'll freshly go to my team lead or the supervisor and she takes it to her boss, and,  you know, the boss takes it to the next level and,  you know, something like that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6963</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6964</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, but that -- I feel like that that's very important.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6965</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh, for a company to be well-run, it has to have, uh,  a c- it's t- has to be able to send a clear message -- as to how to handle problems and who who is the one that's uh,  uh, indicated for -- for those problems -- to handle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6966</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And and people -- those in the company need to be um instructed -- to know wh- where their relative place is in the company.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6967</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So that they they don't overstep their bounds.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6968</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because when that happens, and it that makes, uh, that creates problems for the employees.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6969</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It makes them discontent.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>6970</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean, if they if they can be, eh, um,  you know, jumped on arbitrarily by just about anybody,  then pretty soon, you know, they're they're they're not going to be content at all, they're just going to wonder, well when when's the next hit going to come, you know.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>7087</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I I don't I've never seen it mentioned, I've never -- but -- but if they really wanted to to I don't know uh uh uh if they if they really wanted to put -- fear in the American people,  uh -- I know it would work with me,  is if they say just uh if if -- I say they, Bin Laden, or who whoever -- uh -- uh is running that team now, uh were to -- were to just pick a small -- Mid- American town,</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7371</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, and and what I see is that there is no physical evidence that he did it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7372</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And yeah, it sounds like he did do it because he dyed his hair, was trying to get away, and the anchor and a boat.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7373</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But there's -- -- I for some reason, deep down in my heart, don't believe he did it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7374</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And you know and I think the media made him guilty, and I think -- it's like you know, I mean you saw what happened outside the courtroom, I don't know if you did or not, see how they were cheering on.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7375</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>7387</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7397</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, yeah you have to look, see, I think the locale, that both of them took place, and one took place in ~LA,  which is terribly open- minded and, uh, the other one took place in uh, Mida- well, uh ((Redoak)) City.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Um,  I do think from all the, uh, things that I have heard that he -- had to be guilty with all the evidence that they had, but um,  I don't really know why, uh,  if everybody was so, sort of, obsessed about it when we've got so much other -- things going on in the world that, uh, seem to me much more important, but um.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7673</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Perhaps it was because he seemed, uh, a very human kind of person and, and you cou- you couldn't really understand why he would want to do something about that.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>7722</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Okay, Mark.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7723</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh,  I think it's fresh topic for tonight.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7724</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, yeah.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7725</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Good topic.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7726</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's a good topic.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7727</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So what do you think?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7728</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well,  um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start, generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with the Middle East and what- For me, one of the major problems is the fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the state of Israel.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7729</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensive military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7730</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, for me, that's -- the- that's essentially the root of the problem.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7731</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult position, because you have these,  um, incredibly -- oppressed and in some ways imprisoned,  uh, Palestinians,  and if -- Arafat hadn't, um, tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights, then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat,  but then again, you know, he couldn't be too friendly with the West,  um,  and, um, and so he did the best he could, I think.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7732</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's a difficult -- leadership role.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7733</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um,  what do- Well, how about you?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7734</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think,  yeah, more or less, I c- I agree with what you said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7735</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's almost, this is my view as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7736</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And the question is,  what next?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7737</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean,  some idea -- from Israeli side, they were saying -- he was a problem,  and if he goes, everything will be quite easy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7738</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now he's not in anymore.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7739</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, let us wait and see.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7740</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If he was a problem himself,  hope -uh,  the coming one -- will be in a good -- position to negotiate with the other side, Israel, and then -- peace can be achieved.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7741</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh,  we have to wait and see, but,  uh,  it seems it's not easy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7742</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, unless that -- stops,  the, um,  the leader of the Palestinians -- really can't do too much -- to further the peace process, because -- there are -- a lot of bad things happening to the people -- of that -- leader.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7743</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's correct, as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7744</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, so it's- -- it's kind of, it's- -- it seems like the, um,  the media, at least in the United States, is -- putting all of this -- focus and responsibility on the leader of the Palestinians, as if it was</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7745</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Arafat's fault that any of- -- any of the violence was caused.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7746</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So,  it seems like an unfair treatment -- of- -- of,  you know, the leader of -- the Palestinian people.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7747</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um,  yeah.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7748</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's absolutely correct.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7749</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Actually, it- it's a good topic to be choosing, I mean,  uh, because it's one of the fresh topics.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>7750</DOCNO>

<TEXT>Um,  well, there's been a couple where -- they've- they talked about the Cabinet -- for -- Bush, and Bush has been,  um,  you know,  selecting new Cabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that I'm- I don't really know very well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>7797</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yes, he did.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7798</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um,  there was a show here in New York at a big theater.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7799</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think maybe it was at Lincoln Center in the Philharmonic Theater or the Metropolitan Opera House or the New York State Theater or something.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7800</DOCNO>

<TEXT>The mayor of New York, who was then Rudolph Giuliani,  stood up and walked out, he was also in attendance, and his, uh, comment to the press afterwards was that, you know, he just didn't want to honor a terrorist, and I -- one of the few things that I was happy about with Giuliani when he was mayor.</TEXT>

<DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>7805</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right, I knew that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7806</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But, you know, I- I kind of agreed with that Arafat thing, though.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7807</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I -- but I do think he accomplished something in that the Palestinian people do have a legitimate grievance and he put it on the map, you know.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7808</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, he- -- he did but I think he really failed miserably,  in my opinion, when he,  um,  refused to sign that treaty that was originally set up because it was a wonderful -- option and it really could've re- done some wonderful things for his people and I think he really did them a disservice by not taking care of it at that time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7809</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>7810</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>7812</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm not familiar with it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7813</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, um, where they were going to, uh, give them, like, ninety-six percent of the Ga- of- of Gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred percent.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7814</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And so he refused to sign it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7815</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was just an- an incredible faux pas on his part, from my opinion.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7816</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, y- it's- it's -- you have to sometimes take a little bit less than you want, you know, uh,  an- and ninety-six percent is a big percentage, you know.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7817</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I think that could have really done some wonderful uh steps for -- uh for the Palestinian people uh as a whole.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7818</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I felt -- very sad that, um, that that wasn't -- done.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7819</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It really should've been.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7820</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um, it was really quite unfortunate that- that he -- that he was not willing to,  um, step forward -- to do- do what was really in the best interests of his people.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7821</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Sometimes- sometimes I th- I think it's hard when- when you're the- the first leader, or the George Washington of something, to see things other than in black and white.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7822</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, or maybe he didn't have the gift of- of nuance that would've helped him to- -- to take that right step, uh, you know, the- -- the -- his people suffer so terribly and maybe, you know, it could have been better if he had signed that, huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7823</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I really think so.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7824</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I really, truly do and now it's a- a situation where, with his passing, um, I think there's a real, um, new opening, a new possibility for- -- some extremely positive steps to come forward out of this -- I do think that the United States -- will probably be requested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understand that, I me- uh, because,  um, I think -- both sides -- have a trust in the United States that make it-</TEXT>

<TEXT>uh, millions and millions of dollars that he had is still around but they -- if they bring people in that wasn't involved with his cabinet, n- um,  have different views than him, somebody that gener- genuinely can accept the fact that the Israel- -- Is- Israelis are there and they're there to stay -- and, um,  we going to have to find a way to coexist.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think that it was a front -- for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community, but I think -- that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closer to the Gaza strip, and to re-take Jerusalem -- and other cities near Jerusalem,  and to, uh, uplift his people in a way that -- they could say, you know, we conquered the Israelis.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>7962</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For example,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against Iraq,  the United States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  an invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  putting any attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>7963</DOCNO>
<TEXT>She did wha- what she want.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7964</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe at that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I believe at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh, the prime minister of Israel, his name was Barak,  they met together in the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this ((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>7970</DOCNO>

<DOCNO>8118</DOCNO>
<TEXT>How long ago was it?</TEXT>

<DOCNO>8123</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Over a year ago.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8124</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um,  I'm thinking -- I don't know, November, December, I'm not sure exactly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8125</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I know it was just before Christmas -- when they had uh -- it had happened, because she was missing during Christmas and then they had found her body.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8126</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And they -- they found the baby as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8127</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Terrible.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8128</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um,  so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- they don't know if the baby was born, through delivery,  or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse I guess</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8129</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So the baby was separate.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8130</DOCNO>
<TEXT>maybe extracted it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8131</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um, actually she was pregnant for the baby.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8132</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But the baby was separate from the body when he found it?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8133</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um,  I don't know if ma- I you know I don't know the whole story for sure, but -- um -- he had -- you know, obviously -- denied that he was involved anything to do with it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8134</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Then they found out that he was having an affair on her.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8135</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And -- then of course when they were investigating him -- he tried running.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8136</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Dyed his hair and -- grew out a mustache and -- they caught him trying to run with -- quite a bit of cash.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8137</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So I mean,</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8138</DOCNO>
<TEXT>he's -- in all honesty been guilty all along the way but</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8139</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh-huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8140</DOCNO>
<TEXT>of course you know they've got to give him that reasonable doubt.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8141</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh-huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8142</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So is he is he still um -- in prison now?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8143</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty, or life in prison.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8144</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So that's what's is up in the air right now.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8145</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What state is this in?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8146</DOCNO>
<TEXT>California.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8147</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's in California.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8148</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And -- um -- I know I had, it was supposed to have be deliberated on -- the twenty-second of November,  but they had an issue happen with -- one of the jurors -- so it's postponed everything.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8149</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But,  actually they were trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for there to be a double murder charge.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8150</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Oh, uh-huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8151</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8152</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh-huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8153</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8154</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So he didn't get both first degree murders.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8155</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What's the difference?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8156</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Where -- Um,  I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8157</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm thinking maybe was the difference.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8158</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And because of the the charge on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty, but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8159</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What was his excuse for doing something horrible like that?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8160</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and -- well he still denies everything.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>8163</DOCNO>
<TEXT>to do it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8164</DOCNO>
<TEXT>um -- But the only thing they can figure is that maybe -- he wanted back into the bachelor life, and didn't want to be a father, didn't want to be tied down with a wife and child</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8165</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So he didn't have any other children?</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8267</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8393</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Good, good.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8394</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall I felt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry and Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know, I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that as compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8395</DOCNO>
<TEXT>felt like I could trust Kerry -- uh, little bit more even though he was much more of a politician than Bush.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8396</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh, he was -- kind of a smooth talker and</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8397</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um -- uh -- seems like a politician, they way he presented</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8398</DOCNO>
<TEXT>his you know his his um argument.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8399</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But -- uh -- strangely I felt like that what, that was -- one of -- one of his good qualities because I didn't feel Bush was politician enough.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8400</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That um -- one of the -- issues that I was concerned about was just -- the representation of the United States and -- on the international stage</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8401</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and I just -- uh -- I uh -- I don't know, uh, Bush is -- the way he presents um -- the ~US position -- uh -- seemed a little -- abrasive to me.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8402</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the United States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a nicer way.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8403</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, it seems ((I make)) kind of simplistic, but -- that was -- an important thing for me.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8404</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Um -- I was a little different.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8405</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I I I agree with everything you said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8406</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I just, um -- I come from a little different background as far as being -- I was never into politics and now I I actually have gotten into God much more and and, you know, searching spirituality out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8407</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8408</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Generally people like that are conservative, you know,</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8409</DOCNO>
<TEXT>uh, with their views because of different things like abortion and, and, uh, pro-life and -- all that kind of thing so I came form that background</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8410</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8411</DOCNO>
<TEXT>eh, but that was just an added bonus for me in the fact that -- I too was obviously at this point in time concerned about the welfare of our security -- and I felt personally that if -- Kerry was in office we'd kind of be, uh -- up a creek without a paddle because I think -- he is so laid back -- um, and not as aggressive as Bush that at this point in the game, where we're at -- we're in this thing full full -- steam ahead</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8412</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8413</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and for a transition to occur at this point -- to someone who is laid back -- and not as aggressive as him I think would actually endanger the ~US even more.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8414</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think that the international, uh uh, leaders would look at Kerry and know, they're very smart, I mean they're -- they're on top of these things, they know, you know, it would , it just would have opened a gateway.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8415</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8416</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I feel</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8417</DOCNO>
<TEXT>that, uh, it may have actually put us in more danger.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8418</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At least Bush has -- pulled out the gun, you know, stick to them, and um -- you know, that's where I was coming from on that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8419</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And then when I</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8420</DOCNO>
<TEXT>((Do you think))</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8421</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I listen to a lot of talk radio and when I heard the stuff about Kerry back in the -- the the, apparently the scandals he's pulled as far as the uh, medals when he served time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8422</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8423</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, uh -- I listen to a lot of talk radio and spoke with, you know, heard from a lot of, uh -- veterans -- and they said it was physically, uh, impossible for him to achieve what he said he did.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8424</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8425</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8426</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it's more of a status quo for him.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8427</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think he's more, he got so much money that I think he was just concerned with attaining this position and a title.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8428</DOCNO>
<TEXT>you know ((flag)) for him, so</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8429</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were saying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that it probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry would do the best he could.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8430</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But do you think, um -- that -- and this isn't quite a political issue, but do you think that -- there's going to be another attack on the ~US?</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>8431</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>8450</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I, I believe I've talked about this subject once before too.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8451</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh,  Well, let's see, my past views were, uh -- illness-wise, ah -- I don't think -- it helped him, being in the compound.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8452</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>8453</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8459</DOCNO>
<TEXT>but I don't, you know, from just the generic point, or general point of view, it didn't help his illness once he got -- sick -- being in the compound, closed in like that with the Arabs.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>8464</DOCNO>
<TEXT>for quite some time.</TEXT>
</DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8466</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8467</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, it, it could've only exacerbated, uh,  his situation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8468</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because for -- for a good little while now I've noticed, you know, that his lips would tremble, and</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8469</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and, you know, it's like, um,  uh, almost like he had, uh, what is that, Parkinson's?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8470</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh, something like that, but, uh, I don't know what the exact conditions were -- in that compound, but they couldn't have been couldn't have been, ah, conducive to someone of his age -- and of his health -- and as far as, as, ah, the United States sending a senior ~US official, I think they should've sent someone -- I don't know how senior that person had to be.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8471</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But, uh,  it could've been a gesture</TEXT>
</DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8473</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Didn't they go with a senior official, I had</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8474</DOCNO>
<TEXT>didn't think they were going to ask this question, but I</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8475</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Oh y- yeah, you're right, they did send someone.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8476</DOCNO>
<TEXT>but it wasn't -- like, ah, wasn't Bush, I definitely wouldn't send him, I don't think you want to have him in that part of the world right now.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8477</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8478</DOCNO>
<TEXT>No, I don't think</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8479</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Regardless of what you think about him, he's, ah</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8480</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, I don't think he should have went -- as a matter of fact, I don't think any senior official should've went, I don't think -- Secretary of State Colin Powell should have went.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8481</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh, whoever they sent was, was good enough.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8482</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, was good enough, just to show -- the Palestinian people -- that, uh you know, America does care somewhat -- that you've lost your leader.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8483</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But, uh, no,  it would've been -- it would've been a wro- as a matter of fact, I think sending Bush would have made it worse.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8484</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8485</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh, because he's not liked that much by the Palestinian people.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8486</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So I, I don't think sending him would've been -- would've been the right thing to do.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>8487</DOCNO>
<TEXT>No, I agree with that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8488</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, I don't think it would've added anything to -- to the situation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8489</DOCNO>

<TEXT>who owns it and respect, so I mean it's</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8496</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>8503</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And it's just, you know, They, they, they got to learn at some point -- that they're going to have to be able to get along.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8504</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Or this is just going to keep going around, and around, and around,  and, you know, the the -- the Palestinians will, will, will -- will -- will do something, then Israel will respond, and then back and forth -- and it's just like a never ending circle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8505</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>8535</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, he'd been looking h- like he was shaking and, uh,  seeming frail.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8536</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For some time when I'd see him in public, uh,</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8537</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, that's true.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8539</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8540</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I think it whatever it was, it got him, just caught up with him and and he reached the you know, the end of his time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8541</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So,  that's about it on that, I guess.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8542</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, I I guess now that that he's he's died -- it'll be, uh,  or it it should be a change for the ~PLO</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8543</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, yeah, it'll be change.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8544</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8545</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think he was a block to the peace -- but I think it's not only his doing, it's also the -- you know, the, uh, more, uh, drastic elements of the ~PLO that, uh,  that, uh, wouldn't allow him to pursue peace</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8546</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8547</DOCNO>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>8548</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, I'm -- I'm -- I don't know, uh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8549</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He he seems like a guy who is much more comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peace settlements.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8550</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Uh-huh.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8551</DOCNO>
<TEXT>maybe that</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8552</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, you know, he was kind of damned if he did and damned if he didn't.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8553</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people that would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he's considered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't make peace, you know.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8554</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, he, uh, he couldn't really win.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8555</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I don't think he could make peace.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8556</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I don't know if anyone else can, either.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8557</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, I guess that's the big question, if someone moderate takes over and they reach a settlement,  does that mean the ~PLO will split?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8558</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean that -- that could be just -- dangerous.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8559</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I guess, uh, making peace with half of the Palestinians is better than nothing.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>That we did or d- that we did not send our officials.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8569</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean -- We -- we did,  but i- it was some -- it was a nobody, basically.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<DOCNO>8586</DOCNO>
<TEXT>that ((yeah,)) it -- Yeah.</TEXT>
</DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8588</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's true.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8589</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And, I mean not that it would've even been noticed -- in that regard had he -- had had our president or someone higher gone, but the fact that they didn't, that's what's really going to be noticed, you know what I mean?</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8707</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I don't think either side would have really -- let it happen -- and -- and as far as a senior U.S. official going, I don't think that would have been necessary either.</TEXT>

<DOC>

<TEXT>Um, I know President Bush shouldn't have went -- and he wasn't going.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8710</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think a senior U.S. service in there, should have been there, because I mean -- he, Arafat's been -- been the one coming to all these peace talks, you know, with President Clinton and, you know, other</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8722</DOCNO>
<TEXT>from from the beginning cause I don't, I don't think he ever even met with him.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>8729</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, you know you got to engage people in some type of dialogue</TEXT>

<DOCNO>8730</DOCNO>
<TEXT>if you</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>8731</DOCNO>
<TEXT>to me, the talk, the peace talks should have continued -- after Clinton's administration left.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8732</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Cause at the cause at the end Clinton was doing all this peace talk with Arafat and, um</TEXT>

<TEXT>You're absolutely right.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8738</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I agree.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8739</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Like I said, I think that was one of Bush's biggest mistakes,</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8740</DOCNO>
<TEXT>not continuing -- the talks.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8741</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because Clinton had came so very close</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8742</DOCNO>
<TEXT>to to maybe getting some type of agreement</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8743</DOCNO>
<TEXT>but, uh, Bush just took a hands off approach.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8744</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He just -- kind of took a hands off approach.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8745</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And now the situation in, you know, Jerusalem and the West Bank is just -- escalated.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8746</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Absolutely.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8747</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And I think too -- Israel's -- position toward Arafat -- in terms of keeping him sort of like -- uh -- surrounded in that compound -- I don't think that was a good idea.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8748</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, because that, you can't pick a leader for a people.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8749</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Whether you like them or not -- people get to choose who they want to follow,</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8750</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Exactly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8751</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and the Palestinians had made it clear -- that Arafat was their leader.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8752</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Exactly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8753</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, I think that they, we should have found a way -- Israel should have found a way -- to -- keep some type of dialogue -- going along.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8754</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Cause uh, I mean, you look at what's going on now.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8755</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean, their policy toward him didn't get them anything.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>8756</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And then you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- you know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in a circle.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10032</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The surprise move by France, which led opposition to the U.S. war against Iraq, followed last week's call by U.S. President George W. Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so Iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10033</DOCNO>
<TEXT>France's U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, made the proposal at a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged views on potentially divisive postwar issues.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10034</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The proposal would end the U.N. ban on trade and investment in Iraq while leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place.</TEXT>

<TEXT>An accident on a diesel-powered Chinese submarine has killed all 70 officers and sailors aboard, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Friday.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10154</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The accident occurred ``recently'' in Chinese waters east of the Neichangshan islands, the brief Chinese-language report said.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The islands are in the Yellow Sea, between the northeastern province of Liaoning and North Korea.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>The submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred, and ``because of a mechanical malfunction, the 70 crew members on board died,'' the Xinhua report said.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port, Xinhua said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10159</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It said the hull number was 361, which military analysts said appeared to make it a Ming-class submarine, a vessel used for patrols and coastal defense.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10160</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The announcement was unusual for a communist government that rarely acknowledges military accidents.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10161</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was the first time China has announced a fatal submarine mishap, said Bernard Cole, a professor at the U.N. National War College in Washington and a specialist on the Chinese navy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>``There have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines, but this is the first fatal accident that I know of,'' said Cole.</TEXT>

<TEXT>China's military, which has a tradition of secrecy, did not comment about the accident Friday night.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10164</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for an accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing the vessel to be recovered.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10165</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They suggested possible causes ranging from a sinking in shallow water to a disaster that flooded the vessel with toxic chemical fumes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10166</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Michael McGinty, an expert on the Chinese navy from the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in London, said that the mishap likely happened while the submarine was on the surface.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10167</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the accident happened when the vessel was underwater, it was less likely that China could have recovered it, said McGinty, a former British submariner.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10168</DOCNO>
<TEXT>``For an accident to have been so catastrophic when the submarine was on the surface, I find it a very mysterious thing,'' he said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10169</DOCNO>
<TEXT>McGinty said that the submarine's batteries might have leaked acid that mixed with seawater, creating toxic chlorine gas that killed the crew.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10170</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The torpedoes might have leaked propellant that poisoned the crew, he said.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>The accident could have occurred as long ago as March, said Cole, a former U.S. Navy antisubmarine warfare officer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>``There have been exercises going on in the Yellow Sea over the past two months,'' he said.</TEXT>

<TEXT>``This boat could have been involved in those exercises and gone down over a month ago.''</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10174</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Cole said the loss of all hands suggested the vessel was flooded or sank because of a collision or engineering problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>He said Ming-class subs usually carry a crew of 50, suggesting that the others aboard might have been technicians or staff officers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>China began building the Ming-class subs in the 1970s, and they are obsolete by modern standards, according to the Federation of American Scientists.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>China is believed to have as many as 19 Ming-class submarines.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>10572</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In the assessment, which they have shared with Japan, South Korea and other allies in recent weeks, officials at the Central Intelligence Agency said that U.S. satellites have identified a sophisticated new nuclear testing site in an area called Youngdoktong.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10573</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At the site, equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that, when detonated, could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclear explosion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A two-day summit between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush ended here Tuesday with both countries trying to minimize splits on UN role in rebuilding Iraq after the ongoing US-led war against the country is over.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10647</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As the US-led coalition troops are reportedly thrusting into Baghdad and the second Iraqi city of Basra, Blair and Bush agreed there would be a "vital role" for the United Nations in post-war Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10648</DOCNO>
<TEXT>During their first war summit on March 27 at Camp David,  Blair and Bush became divided over what a role the United Nations will play in postwar Iraq, when Bush gave no positive reaction to Blair 's suggestion of a strong UN role.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10649</DOCNO>
<TEXT>After the Camp David talks, Blair, who analysts say has been pursuing a special relationship with Washington in order to restore Britain's traditional role as a transatlantic "bridge", was forced to readjust his tone.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10650</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Blair and Bush were expected to bridge their gap on the issue by reaching an agreement on UN role in post-war Iraq, some analysts said even before this summit at Hillsborough, south of Belfast, the second of its kind since the war broke out on March 20.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10651</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In a joint written statement, the two allies pledged to seek UN Security Council resolutions to affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, ensure aid delivery and endorse an "appropriate" post- conflict administration for Iraq.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10652</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"We welcome the appointment by the United Nations Secretary- General of a special adviser for Iraq to work with the people of Iraq and coalition representatives," the statement added.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10653</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The United Nations would have a "vital role" in the effort to repair Iraq's infrastructure, Blair told reporters at a news conference after his talks with Bush, downplaying UN role in emphasizing that ultimately the country must be run by the Iraqi people.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10654</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"The key is that Iraq in the end should be governed by the Iraqi people," Blair said, pledging that British and US forces would not stay in the country "a day longer than necessary".</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10655</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was a "false choice" to debate whether Iraq should be run by coalition forces or the United Nations, said Blair, who was believed to be in favor of a stronger UN role in post-conflict Iraq than Bush.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10656</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Echoing Blair, Bush said the UN would play a role in all aspects of post-war Iraq, from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority, adding that Iraq would "move as quickly as possible" to an interim authority made up of Iraqis from inside and outside the country.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10657</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, when pressed on what precisely the UN role would be, Bush on Tuesday mentioned only humanitarian work, "suggesting" people to staff the interim authority and helping Iraq "progress."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10658</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"When we say vital role for the United Nations, we mean vital role for the United Nations in all aspects of the issue, whether it be humanitarian aid, or whether it be helping to stand up an interim authority.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10659</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Iraqi people will decide who's on the Iraqi interim authority," said Bush.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10660</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Bush did not spell out how much power the United Nations would have, nor did he elaborate on Washington's plans to place US officials alongside Iraqis in the interim administration.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10661</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Differences still remain between the United States and Britain, analysts said, over the speed with which Iraq should be handed to an interim Iraqi administration, and the extent to which a US-led group of generals and former diplomats should effectively run the country.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10662</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yet, analysts argued, both Britain and the United States hope their agreed vision of a postwar scenario will placate anti-war nations such as France, Germany and Russia.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10663</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"We will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of Iraqis from both inside and outside the country," Bush vowed at the joint news conference with Blair, adding that the interim authority would serve until a permanent government could be chosen by the Iraqi people.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10664</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"Rebuilding of Iraq will require the support and expertise of the international community.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10665</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We are committed to working with international institutions, including the United Nations, which will have a vital role to play in this task," Bush added.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10666</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Blair also pleaded the world to avoid "endless diplomatic wrangles" over the future of Iraq like the international dispute over a second UN resolution on Iraq that preceded the war.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10667</DOCNO>
<TEXT>France and Germany, which were most vocal in opposing this US- led war against Iraq, have been insisting that the United Nations should play a central role in the phase of post-war Iraq.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let's see...</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10900</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There two main qualities to be desired in a Commander-in-Chief, Generalship and Leadership.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10901</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because in the United States the Commander-in-Chief is a purely political post, generalship is usually undertaken by the generals proper under the Commander-in-Chief, provided it is understood that the Commander-in-Chief is ultimately responsible and accountable for the outcomes of his general's generalship.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10902</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Generalship involves the technical skills of intelligence gathering, strategic and tactical planning, and the communication of orders.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10903</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Leadership can be less rigidly defined and is concerned less with coordination than motivation and how a commander seeks to inspire his men to fight harder and endure worse privations in order to beat the enemy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10904</DOCNO>
<TEXT>President Bush generalship has proven deficient.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10905</DOCNO>
<TEXT>His planning for the war was inadequate and his monitoring of the war after the invasion failed to correct course in the face of the change in circumstances brought by a strong and unexpected insurgency.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10906</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Commander-in-Chief's generalship can suffice to motivate men if they are higly confident that he is a very capable and skilled general.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10907</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Eisenhower was in that position.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10908</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That has not been the case with President Bush, who unleashed hell acting on faulty intelligence, failed to find any WMD, and left our boys at war wanting for armor.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10909</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That is not the sort of generalship that on rational grounds alone motivates men to march to possible death.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Men unmotivated by bad generalship can still be motivated by exceptional leadership.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10911</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In theory, motivation is best carried out by a commander fighting alongside his men.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10912</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Make no mistake, even when we don't desire a president with a preference for personal combat, the need for a commander to be seen to share dangers with his men is as imperative today as it was in times of Alexander of Macedon.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10913</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's why we look at the military record of our leaders.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10914</DOCNO>
<TEXT>John Kennedy, George H. Bush, and even John Kerry, the loser, had distinguished military careers that were apt substitutes for leading men in battle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10915</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The knowledge that the Commander-in-Chief once faced grave danger in war bravely can be the animating spirit of troops facing the same dangers.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10916</DOCNO>
<TEXT>George W. Bush has no distinguished military career.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10917</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In fact, CBS and carrier landings notwithstanding, there is every indication that in the peak of youth he avoided the dangers of war as much as he could.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10918</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That is not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone motivates men to march to possible death.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10919</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Some might say that George W. Bush is neither a general nor a soldier, he is a politician.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10920</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He is in charge of Grand Strategy and he delegates the rest.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10921</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But as Commander-in-Chief he is the Ultimate General and the First Soldier.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10922</DOCNO>
<TEXT>George W. Bush, the Politician, is not very good at grand strategy either.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>10923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The aim of grand strategy is a prosperous and secure peace, and by his several blunders over the psychology of his opponents, the political and economic effects of his actions, and the failure to erradicate terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist, George W. Bush, he has failed to realize the aim of grand strategy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There were no accusations by her.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>Drug sensitivities are one of the difficulties of that disorder.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>Since they knew he had it, that's probably why she's not questioning this issue.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>I often wondered how he was doing with all the meds because of his illness, which developed before his paralyzing accident.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's actually a testament to his stamina and his doctors that he was able to survive as long as he did with this disorder complicating his care.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not sure about this disagreement you are speaking of between her version and the doctors version of his cause of death.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I know about allergic reactions and meds, I've been a nurse for 20 years.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

</DOC>

<TEXT>A change of that sort would be very simple to implement, and most church members would like it better than allowing non-LDS family members into the temple, which would actually be my preference.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>11162</DOCNO>

<TEXT>*shrugs* I chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and I were both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both families completely.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>11290</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Then there was the class action suit against Gateway brought by some Philadelphia lawyers a number of years ago.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11291</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Gateway advertised and stickered many of its 486 computers as "Pentium Ready", meaning that a special Type 3 ZIF socket Pentium OverDrive could be installed and run.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11292</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Micronics designed the motherboards used by Gateway, and the basis of the design was a prototype Pentium OverDrive with an internal write-through cache, a more conservative cache design.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11293</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Then Intel changed the Pentium OverDrive, and the final version had a write-BACK cache.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11294</DOCNO>
<TEXT>When installed in a Gateway system, the chip ran slower than slow, maybe about as fast as an IBM AT, and bus-mastering devices like NICs and SCSI cards refused to work.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11295</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So the lawyers sued Gateway, and the settlement approved by the judge consisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of Gateway 486 computers.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11296</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The coupon was good for $50 off on the purchase of a Pentium OverDrive processor from Gateway, at its usual inflated prices !!!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11297</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, let's see.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11298</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What does a discount coupon for a processor I can't use in my system do for me?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11299</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I wonder how many people gleefully cashed in their coupons and bought Pentium OverDrives from Gateway.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11300</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Intel eventually compensated by making available an "interposer", a little socketed thingie installed between the Pentium OverDrive and the ZIF socket.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11301</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The sole purpose of the interposer was to raise a signal on the CPU to force its cache to operate in the write-thru mode which was compatible with most ZIF Socket 3 486 motherboards.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11302</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Needless to say, this was the least successful "OverDrive" CPU ever done by Intel.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11303</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The 486-DX4 OverDrive was OK, as were several Socket 5 Pentium OverDrives and the Socket 8 Pentium Pro OverDrive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>They also stated that there are lots of places in the world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too - quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are getting less donations now.</TEXT>

<DOC>

<TEXT>my question isa this, what the heck is a waiver of extradition good 4 ?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11475</DOCNO>
<TEXT>How will her probation be affected here?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11476</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I ask around locally and no one will reply, not her public defender, the public defenders office, so I guess this is my last resource cuase I cannot afford to consult with an attorney.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>11477</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Thanks in advance, MLM the guy who shoulda known better.............</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11478</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The waiver of extradition that she signed simply means that if she skips out and goes to another state, she can't contest the right of the original court to have her hauled back to its jurisdiction, and that the court won't have to initiate the time-consuming process of extraditing her.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11479</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Instead, if the cops pick her up, she can be shipped back without delay.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11480</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Might be time to find a new girlfriend... this one seems to have a habit of ducking out when things get rough.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>11482</DOCNO>
<TEXT>She's going to have a lot of separate offenses to account for by this time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11483</DOCNO>
<TEXT>2 "FTA"s (failure to appear), one in FL and one in AZ, plus whatever the original charges were in both cases.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11484</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That means she has given up the right to force the FL authorities to go thru legal due process in demanding that the AZ authorities turn her over to them for further prosecution.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11485</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All the FL prosecutors have to do is ask, and the AZ jailers will pack her up in a van or a plane and ship her back to FL for trial on the FTA charge and probably to commence her serving time under the suspended sentence that went along with her original probation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11486</DOCNO>
<TEXT>She's in DEEP SH__T if you haven't already figure that out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11487</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Nowhere in USA would be far enough if she waived extradition.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11488</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Of course they do.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11489</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's what her waiver of extradition meant they could do.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11490</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They let her serve her time in AZ, then they come and get her to serve her time in FL.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11491</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is what happens when people blow off the chances they are given to straighten out by being given probation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11492</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Thumb your nose at the court often enough, and they will bring all sorts of crap down on your head, re-instituting the original suspended sentences and possibly adding on for the FTA.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11493</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What is it GOOD for?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11494</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's good for the STATE, not for the convict.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11495</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It lets them skip some of the legal procedures she would otherwise be entitled to, in order to ship her from one state to another.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11496</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But they were entitled to demand that waiver as a condition of probation; if she had not agreed to voluntarily waive that right, they probably would have just thrown her in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she wouldn't have been given the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11497</DOCNO>
<TEXT>She doesn't have a lot of leeway here.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11498</DOCNO>
<TEXT>She has done this numerous times and they are not likely to give her another wide open chance like they did the first 3 times.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11499</DOCNO>
<TEXT>She will probably have to serve out her sentence in FL, AND if she has not already served all her time in AZ, they will then ship her back there to do THAT time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11500</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Waitaminit, you said she DOES have a public defender?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11501</DOCNO>
<TEXT>OK, he/she is doing all they can, but that's not much, under the circumstances.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Question regarding simple assault & battery</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11515</DOCNO>
<TEXT>My roommate was hospitalized in mid-November for lung surgery and spent several days on loads of pain medication.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11516</DOCNO>
<TEXT>On the fourth day of his stay, he was moved out of the ICU to the step-down unit, with a diagnosis of "ICU Psychosis secondary to narcotic administration" and post thoracostomy."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11517</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He was confused, because of the medication but was not aggressive or threatening in any manner.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11518</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I saw him each day and as soon as we spoke, he became oriented and was perfectly fine.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This was witnessed by both the nursing staff and his doctors.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day, he got up, dressed, pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and across four lanes of busy evening traffic, to our apartment.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>By the time he got to our home, he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly who told me "he's crazy and just walked out."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11522</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I sat him down on the couch and talked to him, and asked him what had happened.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11523</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He said he'd asked for something for pain and they told hime he couldn't have anything.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11524</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Then the orderly was apparently rude to him, and that's when he got up and decided to come home.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11525</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A short time later, two police officers showed up and told me they had to take him back to the hospital.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11526</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He went back with the officers, gave them no problems at all.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11527</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I received a call from the shift supervisor who told me they'd replaced his chest tube, given him some pain medication and he was doing much better.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11528</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I told her to pass on the other shifts that if he became confused or upset to call me, and I'd talk to him, and get him settled down.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11529</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At 2:15 the next morning, I received a call from the night shift supervisor who told me my friend had been "verbally abusive and aggressive" and would I come over and talk to him.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11530</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, I went over there, getting to his room right at 2:30.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11531</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There were two cops there and I asked what had happened.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11532</DOCNO>
<TEXT>My roommate was in bed, sound asleep, and had all of his clothes on.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11533</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A nurse said, "He beat two of us up.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11534</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The cops are here because we're pressing charges."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11535</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I've lived with this man 9 years and never in that time have I ever seen him be aggressive, violent or abusive in anyway.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11536</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he'd alledgedly hit and was told I couldn't do that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11537</DOCNO>
<TEXT>An hour or so passed and the got my roommate out of bed, took his chest tube out and discharged him.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11538</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He was sent to another hospital with a psych unit until his psychosis resolved.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11539</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I was given copies of a citation for simple assault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to find out what other paperwork was available on this incident.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11540</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I was given a copy of a different citation, but with the identical information from the one I'd gotten the night of the incident.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11541</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almost lost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left large marks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11542</DOCNO>
<TEXT>According to the police report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of the injuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke this incident.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11543</DOCNO>
<TEXT>My roommate has no recollection of the time from the day before the incident happened until he woke up at the other hospital.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11544</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He was cited for simple assault and battery.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11545</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All of his belongings were returned to me upon his discharge, with the exception of the belt buckle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11546</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The police do not have it and the hospital doesn't know what happened to it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11547</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also, I was looking at both citations, I didn't get to the hospital until 2:30 am, and the officer has the time of incident as being at 2:34 am.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11548</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Does anyone besides me see a problem with any of this?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11549</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What kind of recourse does my roommate have in all of this?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>In addition, I's suggest raising the stakes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11554</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The hospital obviously knew that your friend was having head problems, and they improperly treated him by not sending him to a psych ward, which allowed the situation to get worse until the point where he assaulted someone.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11573</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If North Korea has had nuclear weapons for a few years then they developed them during the Clinton Administration.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11574</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Clinton Administration also allowed Loral to sell Missile technology to China, who have been helping Pakistan to build their missiles.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11575</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That technology has undoubtably made it back to North Korea (Pakistan, Iran and North Korea are all working on the same set of missile blue prints).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11576</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So now we have North Korea with nuclear weapons and workable missiles.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>Also since we missed the boat on North Korea and Nuclear weapons how can we be sure that Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11578</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The simple and wisest action is to assume that they do have a small number and are working feverishly to build a bigger arsenal.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11579</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now the nut of the question should be, What if Iran gives, sells, provides nuclear weapons to Islamic extremists to smuggle into the United States and at 10 AM on a Wednesday pop 2 or 3 in New York City, destroying Wall street, the large banks, the large Insurance companies, the large sock brokerage houses and many other world wide financial institutions.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was the trustee informed of the transfer of the shares?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11620</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Since you gave your uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should have become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debts.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11621</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trustee did nothing about them, then you may be ok; however, if you failed to inform the trustee, then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets, which would, at the minimum, invalidate his discharge.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11622</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Even if the transfer doesn't invalidate the whole discharge, the distribution might be subject to forfeiture to pay creditors' claims if you failed to inform the trustee of the share transfer.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11623</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcy matter, not a tax matter.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11624</DOCNO>
<TEXT>the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that was when i gave him the shares.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11625</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He had no shares in 2003.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11626</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received the bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11627</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge didn't come until June of 2004.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11628</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11629</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11630</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing about it, you are more likely than not ok, but if the trustee wasn't informed of the fact directly, then you may be in trouble.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11631</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him).</TEXT>

<TEXT>What's the BTK killer?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11644</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A serial killer in Wichita, Kansas who killed at least 8 people in the '70s and '80s.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11645</DOCNO>
<TEXT>BTK stands for bind, torture, and kill.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>He sent several letters to the police and the media during that time.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11659</DOCNO>
<TEXT>-the BTK killer was only found out when his daughter recognized certain traits and turned in her DNA, which was a close match to the DNA on file for her father.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>11660</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Like in the case of the Unibomber, if it wasn't for the foresight and charity of a relative, the BTK killer would still be loose.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>11682</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If you get out on parole, what happens then, and how long does it last?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11683</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific, but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to get parole, or just do the time and leave again?</TEXT>

<TEXT>-Mark Erikson</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11685</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while serving time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11686</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So you're basically free, with the expectation that you will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular basis (I think they give you a schedule).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11687</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I *believe* you are also expected to get a job, housing, etc.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11688</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and report this also.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11689</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In some cases you may be referred to a specific 'halfway' house for reintroduction into society, and provided with a simple job.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11690</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As for how long it lasts, I would say that it lasts for the rest of your sentence, but I'm not sure about that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11691</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also, you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave, or call a taxi I guess.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>Not just state-specific, judge(jury)-specific and case-specific.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>For some reason, I can't recall if selling drugs to minors qualifies as a jury trial or what.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11694</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But these decisions are entirely up to the judge/jury, and the decision is usually made in regard to the character of the defendant.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Here on the left edge of the country, we have a unique perspective on election standards.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11712</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In Iraq, an election takes place in which one of the three major forces vying for control of the country opts out.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>A few people will turn out and elect somebody.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>11714</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is hailed as the greatest triumph of democracy since the defeat of Imperial Japan.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>11715</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In Washington State, our governor's race may be undecided for months to come.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11716</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Following the election and recount process exactly as outlined in our state constitution, the democratic candidate won by a margin of less than 200 votes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11717</DOCNO>
<TEXT>With roughly three million votes cast in the race, the margin of victory was a few ten thousands of one percent or some such microscopic amount.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11718</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For all intents and purposes it was a tie- but somebody had to end up with a few more votes and this time around it was the demos.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11719</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The same group of people who have said "even if some regions are too unsafe for people to go to the polls and even if large portions of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome, some election is better than no election, and it's a great day for democracy!</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11722</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So the standards are: Any old process halfway resembling an election is just diddly dandy in Iraq, but we won't accept the results of a free and fair election in Washington State because there may have been a human error rate of 0.0000001 percent.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11723</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In Washington State, the election has to be not only free and fair, but also "perfect".</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>11791</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The truth about this election is this: Florida and Ohio had to go for Bush in order for him to "win" the election.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11792</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In reality he lost both states.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11793</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In fact, he did not even win the popular vote.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11794</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He lost the national popular vote by at least 1,750,000.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11795</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This shows you the scale of the fraud.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11796</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The exit polls were not wrong.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11797</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Kerry was the clear winner, but victory was snatched from him.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11798</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Florida first.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11799</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The 200,000+ margin of victory for Bush made this state uncontestable.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11800</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Everybody assumes that even with some fraud, Kerry could never have made up the difference in a recount.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11801</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But Kerry actually won by about 750,000 votes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11802</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The numbers were changed by a computer program (in both electronic and scan-tron voting systems) called "KerryLite.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11803</DOCNO>
<TEXT>""KerryLite" of course is not actual name of the program.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11804</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The actual name is 11-5-18-18 etc.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11805</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For additional encryption, the numbers were jumbled but I'm not sure in which order.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11806</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The numbers replace the letters of the alphabet.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11807</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For example, K is the eleventh letter of the alphabet.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11808</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So the if-then statement goes something like this: "if total true Kerry)total true Bush, Bush x 1.04x (.04 is a random number)(total true Kerry), total true Bush".</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11809</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The second part of the equation takes the total number of votes cast and subtracts the new Bush total, subtracts the third party totals and leaves the rest for Kerry.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11810</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Sometimes the program would also reduce third party votes and award them to Bush.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11811</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And even where Bush legitimately won, he was still awarded additional votes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11812</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The big Democratic counties (Broward for example) went to Kerry because it had to appear that everything was on the up and up.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11813</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's interesting to see this unfold.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11814</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Does anybody wonder why the Republican counties were mostly counted after the Democratic counties?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11815</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You should wonder, and also know that this was no accident.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11816</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Bush team had to make up the votes as the night went on.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11817</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In Ohio, computer voting fraud, vote tossing and voter suppression were the main methods.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11818</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Vote tossing was simply the removal of Kerry votes and some third party votes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11819</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In some areas, the Bush vs. Kerry votes were absurd.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11820</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Nine to one, eight to two.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11821</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Voter suppression took the form of making voters stand in four hour long lines.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11822</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This of course took place in Democratic areas.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11823</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The simplest thing to do was to have too few voting machines.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11824</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Sometimes that's all it takes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11825</DOCNO>
<TEXT>People eventually lose patience and leave without casting a vote.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11826</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In other states such as New Mexico, Nevada, Iowa and New Hampshire, Kerry's leads evaporated very quickly once the polls were shut down.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11827</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Kerry only won New Hampshire, but barely.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11828</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As it turned out, the lead was 6% for Kerry in that state and not enough fraudulent activity took place to flip the state to Bush.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11829</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So this will all come out and be known to everyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really couldn't believe what I was watching while Bush put medals on Talent, Franks and Bremer.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11835</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Talent was in charge of the CIA when two of the most costly intelligence failures in American history happened -- not recognizing the Sept. 11 plot, and wrongly claiming that Saddam had a stockpile of WMDs.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11836</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Even people who mindlessly defend Bush's policies, like wjb67, don't want to take responsibility for Talent -- they point out that he was originally appointed by Clinton.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11837</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Franks was in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take over Iraq, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through the end of the decade.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11838</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And Bremer decided to destroy the existing Iraqi army, leaving it up to us and new recruits to try to impose order.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11839</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is just one more of those wierd, through-the-looking-glass moments when Bush is trying to make something that at the very least has to be seen as troubling, and that I consider an unmitigated failure, into a success.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11840</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Troubling indeed....I will say go a little easier on Franks-not that he deserves a medal- than the other two idiots though.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11841</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He was not given very much to work with--Cheney and Rummy are the ones to blame for the screwed up war plans-of course I am sure they will get their medals too.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11842</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Bush is one of those guys that just sees how he wants to see, and that is a terrible trait for a leader to have---rose-colored something something I beleive it's called.</TEXT>

<TEXT>if countries we don't like start developing nuclear weapons-grade material it makes us nervous.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11870</DOCNO>
<TEXT>but when you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other countries into a war, you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove his case against iran.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11871</DOCNO>
<TEXT>maybe because oil is a much bigger polluting source of energy than nuclear?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11872</DOCNO>
<TEXT>or maybe because it's more cost effective for them to use nuclear than any other method?</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is one Carousel organization again</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11900</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I just received the latest issue of Merry-Go-Roundup, the quarterly publication of the National Carousel Association .</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11901</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In it was a blurb reporting that the American Carousel Society had recently disbanded.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11902</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizations in the first place.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11903</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of The Carousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11904</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Other founders included Charlotte Dinger, who was already a major collector of carousel artwork at the time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11905</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The purpose of the NCA is "to promote conservation, appreciation, knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete wooden carousels."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11906</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The organization attracted a wide range of members, including carousel enthusiasts, owners/operators, theme and amusement parks, museums, libraries, those in the entertainment/recreation industry, art collectors and even auction houses, among others.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11907</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was the presence of these last two named groups that would eventually stir up controversy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11908</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Thanks in large part to the NCA, the art of the carousel was receiving a lot of public attention and appreciation that it had not enjoyed before.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11909</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, this new and brighter spotlight on these antique rides also had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collectibility and monetary value of operational carousels.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They had become worth more money dead (i.e.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11911</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11912</DOCNO>
<TEXT>functioning).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11913</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As such, during the 1980's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be broken up at the auction block, as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11914</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation, as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses, while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable (thrill) rides.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11915</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit, a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11916</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The increasing rift between the "preservationists" and "collectors" would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the NCA to walk out of the group, including founders such as Charlotte Dinger and others.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11917</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The preservationists would chose to remain with the NCA, including Fred Fried.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11918</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At this time in the late 1970's, carousel artwork collector and printer Marge Swenson was the editor of the NCA's Merry-Go-Roundup publication.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11919</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The political struggle that occurred within the NCA resulted in two slates of officers being presented for approval to the membership, something that was not supposed to happen.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11920</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A thicker-than-usual issue of the Roundup would be filled with accusations from both factions in the group each accusing the other of improper behavior.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11921</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Swenson herself would also leave the NCA.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11922</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Not much later, she began publishing her own magazine called "Carousel Art", which was essentially a scholarly photo album depicting different carvers and styles each month.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Meanwhile, those collectors who left the National Carousel Association banded together to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11924</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For the next couple of decades, the two carousel organizations would co-exist, each attracting its share of members.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11925</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Some would actually join both groups, and even attend both of their annual conventions.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11926</DOCNO>
<TEXT>During the mid-1980's Walter Louck would begin publishing "The Carousel Trader", later renamed "The Carousel News & Trader".</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11927</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This monthly magazine would cover all angles and sides of the story of the carousel and be well received by all carousel enthusiasts.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11928</DOCNO>
<TEXT>About a decade later, Carousel Art would suddenly cease publication.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11931</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Coincidentally and amazingly, the art of building hand-carved carousels (and even bandorgans) has been revived, with firms such as Carousel Works and Carousel Magic again building the popular rides in classic design.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11932</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This development seems to have greatly alleviated the antique marketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carousels over the past several decades.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11933</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The turn of the new millenium actually witnessesed a thaw in the relationship between the National Carousel Association and American Carousel Society, as newer and younger leadership took over from the founding generation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11934</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The two groups decided that the bickering between them was wasteful, conterproductive and pointless.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11935</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There was talk of a (re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11936</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, it was decided that NCA and ACS hold joint conventions to save on costs to both the clubs and the members.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11937</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11938</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So now, once again there is a single nationwide organization to join if you love carousels!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Club Sports policies at schools; specifically travel restrictions</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11941</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Hello everyone -</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11942</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I am attempting to learn more information about the policies of various athletic departments at schools, specifically with regards to ultimate teams.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11943</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At Northwestern, the Men's Ultimate team falls under the Club Sports department which falls into a dark, barely lit corner of the Athletic Department.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11944</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There are some restrictions on what we can and cannot do.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11945</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The one that I am most interested in comparing to similar policies at other schools concerns our ability to travel.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11946</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At Northwestern, we are allowed to either rent school vans for no charge or take our own vehicles to tournaments within 300 miles of Evanston, IL.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11947</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also, we are allowed to fly, take a bus, or take Amtrak to any tournament we want, no matter how far away it is.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11948</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We are allowed to compete under the Northwestern name if we take any of these options.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11949</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, it often occurs that we want to go to a tournament farther than 300 miles without flying.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11950</DOCNO>
<TEXT>(For example, Regionals is often slightly farther than 300 miles, yet a reasonable drive.)</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11951</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If we choose to do so, it is understood that we are not officially competing under the Northwestern name - we are just a group of people playing ultimate at a tournament and not involving the university in any way.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11952</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Do any of you other college players face similar restrictions in your travel?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11953</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What are your schools' policies?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11954</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I am interested in both the responses of players at public and private schools.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>11959</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Pitt gets $2000/year towards competition.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11960</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That means bids, hotel, transportation, jerseys (I do have to mention, our jerseys this year are hot).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11961</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That doesnt go very far, and thats a hard cap on anything related to competition for all competetive club sports teams.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11962</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Next year we will be budgeting our jerseys as "practice jerseys" however, so we hope they'll be paid for.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11963</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The point is, $2k gets us to about a tournament and a half using University transportation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11964</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I dont know about playing officially under the university's name, or why that matters really.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>As long as the registrar signs off on the roster for the UPA, doesnt the importance of University affiliation become moot?</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>11966</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I should clarify that NU does not specifically pay for us to fly - we get a budget as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11967</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We pay for our flights/rental cars out of pocket.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11968</DOCNO>

<TEXT>At SUNY Albany in NY, about as state school as you can get, we get about 500 less than what you're talking about at Pitt.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11972</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Our school doesn't really care what we do at tournaments or how far away we are.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11973</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We take our own cars to every tournament, even ones down in Maryland.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11974</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The money we get from our student association has to pay for jerseys, is supposed to help us with tournaments, etc.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11975</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Every tournament our team goes to, we each pay 10-20 bucks out of pocket.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Most tournaments will house you if you ask and explain your situation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11979</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If we can't get housing, we camp out somewhere.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>11982</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For you northwestern guys, you really need to get in touch with someone at your school that will listen.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11983</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Our school didn't like us for a long time, but we behaved ourselves, and very respectfully approached various people, working our way up the ladder, about changing some policies.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11984</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Start off low, and work your way up.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>11985</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Explain to them that if you are driving your own cars, you should be able to go wherever you want, and even throw in there if for any reason you bring shame to the university, you will go right back to the old policy no questions asked.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Another thing we did was have a lot of fundraisers on campus, entered banner contests for sporting events, etc.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>My wife and I were guests at a wedding on the Carnival Legend on New Years Eve 2003.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12001</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All the guests were folks who had met the bride and groom (an attractive young couple who were sailing alone) virtually on cruisecritic.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12002</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The wedding took place in the afternoon, before the ship set sail.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12003</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Thus, the couple was actual married by a justice of the peace in the state of Florida.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12004</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was a great way to begin a cruise.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12005</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Although I am not certain of this, I assume that renewing your vows could actually be done while the ship was at sea, because it would not involve any legal issues.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>12006</DOCNO>
<TEXT>-Has anybody out there seen this done?</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>12009</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They had one of the larger lounges closed off for a private reception.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12010</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I didn't think it was allowed any more, but 30 minutes until sailing an announcement was made that all NON CRUISE guests must make their way to disembark the ship prior to sailing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12011</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I had never heard that announcement before so I assumed that it was for the people attending the wedding on board?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hi All,</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12065</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We *just* got back into Washington last evening, after our brief 5-day trip to London.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12066</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Thanks for all of the responses to my earlier inquiries, I'm happy to report that everything went pretty well, but both my wife and I are pretty beat/tired.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12067</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We got into Heathrow on Monday morning.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12068</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At the airport, I got some cash from the Barclays ATM just outside the arrival area, as many have suggested.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12069</DOCNO>
<TEXT>FYI, I just checked my bank account, and we got charged a $2.00 fee and the exchange rate was around $1.92/GPB.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12070</DOCNO>
<TEXT>After that, we took the underground into London.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12071</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Zone 1-6 all-day pass cost 5.40 GBP each.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12072</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That was pretty easy... the most difficult part was finding the hotel once we finally got off at the final tube station.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12073</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The hotel was nice enough to let us check in, even though we were a bit early (we got in around 12:30, normal check-in time was 14:30), which we were really grateful for, after dragging our bags for a couple of hours.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12074</DOCNO>
<TEXT>After settling into the hotel room (my wife is an "unpack everything-and-stow it" type of person), we went to do a little exploring.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12075</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Being that this was a holiday, a lot of the local places were closed (including restaurants in the hotel), but we found a kind of combo newsagent/foodstore nearby, and we picked up a 5 GBP calling card (for calling home) and some drinks (1.59 GPB for ~2 liter Pepsi light, .98 GBP for a ~2 liter water).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12076</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It took us awhile, but we found a restaurant/pub (White Swan) that was open.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12077</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It seemed like a kind of local place, and the woman that was running the place was very nice.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12078</DOCNO>
<TEXT>When we walked in, we stood around waiting to be seated :), and she said "this is a pub, sit anywhere, and order at the bar".</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12079</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I gathered (from that and a few visits at other pubs) that that's the norm.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12080</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Anyway, we had a nice late lunch: fish and chips (with "mashed peas") for me, and a beef pie for my wife.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12081</DOCNO>
<TEXT>FYI, this was probably the most reasonable meal that we had during our whole visit.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12082</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That night, we walked around the area around the Victoria underground station, because we were suppose to meet up with a tour the next morning.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12083</DOCNO>
<TEXT>While there, we found a local Sainsbury (kind of a small supermarket) about 2 blocks from the underground station, and stocked up on some cheese, milk, and croissants.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12084</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Prices here were a bit cheaper than the local foodstore, and during our trip, I made several trips here :).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12085</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We weren't sure what we wanted to eat for dinner, so we just wandered around a bit, and finally ended up at a "steakhouse" near the station...big mistake.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12086</DOCNO>

<TEXT>I guess we should have figured that one out when 3 other parties walked out AFTER being seated, but unfortunately, we had already ordered, so we felt kind of obligated to finish.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We took an all day bus tour (Evan Evans), including the London Eye.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12090</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Took the underground to Victoria, and walked to the Victoria Coach Station (it's NOT the same :)).</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>12091</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I thought that the tour was a pretty good way to get introduced to part of the city.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12092</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This tour included lunch at another pub near Trafalgar Square (more beef pies for us), and the tour guide was very good, and kind of funny.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>12093</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was kind of like travelling with a "grand dad" and he did his best to keep us all together.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12094</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At the end of the land tour, we went on ride on one of the Thames cruise boats (warning, it is FREEZING on the top deck...), and then a ride on the London Eye.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12095</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All in all, recommended, but afterwards, both my wife and I agreed that an "all-day" tour was too exhausting (even on a bus tour, you have to do a LOT of walking especially getting to the Changing of the Guards and at the London Tower), and we probably would've preferred breaking it into 2 1/2 day tours.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12096</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We also took one of the hop-on/hop-off bus tours (the "Original") on one of the other day, as we thought it was the easiest way to get around to the places that we wanted to re-visit.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12097</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A couple of comments: take the one with the live guide if you can, as it's much more interesting than the ones with the recorded commentary (you can ask questions).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12098</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We had been buying the 2-zone all-day tube passes (4.20 GBP each) everyday, just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own, but by the time this was all over, my wife didn't feel like taking the underground back to Heathrow, so we had asked the hotel conceierge to make a reservation on an airport bus (15 GBP each), but he instead offered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35 GBP, which is what we did.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12099</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This was perfect, because it got us door-to-door from the hotel to LHR Terminal 3 with no hassles at all.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12100</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I wouldn't have done that from LHR to the hotel, but since the concierge was arranging it, I felt that it'd be safe, and the driver turned out to be pretty nice.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12101</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Overall, it was an enjoyable, but really exhausting trip (we live in the suburbs, so I guess we're not use to walking everywhere).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12102</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Luckily this wasn't a "shopping" trip, because things are (at least from Americans) really expensive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in Austin, Tx, and being one who's only been as far as Nashville, Tn two friends and I are planning a trip to New England for a week.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>12121</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'd love some insight or suggestions on our trip itinerary --</TEXT>

<DOC>

<TEXT>First i went to Expedia and did some flight checks.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12130</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Friday, July 8th - Drive back to Boston passing through New York -- do whatever -- 262 Miles from Red Banks to Boston but add whatever miles from New York - Stay the night with friends in Boston</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12131</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Saturday, July 9th - Fly back to Austin</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12132</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I figure staying in Red Bank, NJ, which isn't far from NYC, is cheaper then staying in the city.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12133</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Plus while driving back north to Boston we can spend the day in NYC.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12134</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I know there's WAY too much to do, but I have another friend who works at the MET I'll try to hook-up with.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12135</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We'll plan our few hours in NYC wisely.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12136</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also we're hanging in Boston for so many nights to visit with the friends there and hit the sights in that area.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12137</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also this is a vacation, so we hope to spend some time just chilling.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12138</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Any suggestions on changes?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12139</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We have 3 people going, and Expedia shows the flight (round trip) and a rental car with unlimited miles being $1430, plus I'm figuring about $150 for gas and at $120 a night for hotel that's $360 total for that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12140</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So total cost (without food, spending cash, parking, toll roads, etc) is $1910 or about $637 each.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12141</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm figuring about $850 per person should be plenty for everything -- and that's not bad for 7 nights in New Enland with all the stuff we're planning.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12142</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Did I miss anything or does anyone see any suggestions or changes that might either save money or make our trip more worthwild?</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>12143</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Thanks again, and take care,</TEXT>

<TEXT>Unless there's something in particular you want to see in Toronto, I don't see any reason to make this long side trip.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12148</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I would suggest heading back to Red Bank or wherever and trying to carve out an extra day in New York City.</TEXT>

<TEXT>You can find hotels in your price range, especially with three sharing a room.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12150</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You might want to drop off the car somewhere near Red Bank, or as soon as you arrive in New York, if the drop off charges aren't too much.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12151</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Then you could spend part of one day in New York (and a good part of the next day, assuming you dropped Toronto).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12152</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Then you could take the train or bus back to Boston.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12153</DOCNO>

<TEXT>Here's how I figured the price I'm factoring in -- Boston to Niagara Falls - 467 Miles Niagara Falls to Toronto - 85 Miles and 85 Miles back Niagara Falls to Red Bank, NJ - 435 Miles Red Bank, NJ to Boston (plus spending some time in NYC) - 262</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12165</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Total is 1334, but I'm figuring 1500 with some extra for around NYC and various towns we visit.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12166</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We're getting a mid-sized vehicle, so if the car gets 20 mpg that's 75 gallons used.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12167</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This times $1.90 is $145.50 or around that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12168</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Even if gas is $2.00 a gallon that's still only around $150, so I think $200+ for gas is a rather high estimate.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12169</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also is it possible to take a train from Boston to NYC?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sunnis say Iraq poll illegitimate A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the vote.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12245</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The clerics had encouraged Sunnis to boycott the elections because of the presence of US and foreign troops.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12246</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The US and Iraqi authorities, as well as the United Nations, have hailed the election as a "victory for democracy".</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12247</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But the Association of Muslim Scholars says any government elected in the poll will not reflect the people's will.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12248</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sects, parties and currents with their influence in Iraq boycotted," the association said in a statement.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12249</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"This necessarily means the coming national assembly and government that will emerge from it will not possess the legitimacy to enable them to draft the coming constitution," it said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12250</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The group said whilst it would respect the choice of Iraqis who had chosen to vote, it would regard the new government as having only limited powers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to vote.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12256</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Fundamentally, choosing not to vote is actually a vote for the other side.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12257</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If you choose not to vote, then you choose to give your opponents all the power.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12258</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the Sunni's were prevented, or restricted or otherwise not allowed to vote, then they could claim illegitimacy, but since the simply just collectively decided not to vote, then they declared the vote legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to all non-Sunnis.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>Enron & India</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12331</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In India, Bechtel along with General Electric are the new owners of the notorious and currently defunct Enron power project.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12332</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Enron contract, which legally binds the Government of the State of Maharashtra to pay Enron a sum of 30 billion dollars, was the largest contract ever signed in India.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12333</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Enron was not shy to boast about the millions of dollars it had spent to "educate" Indian politicians and bureaucrats.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12334</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Enron contract in Maharashtra, which was India's first 'fast-track' private power project, has come to be known as the most massive fraud in the country's history.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12335</DOCNO>
<TEXT>( Enron was another of the Republican Party's major campaign contributors).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12336</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The electricity that Enron produced was so exorbitant that the government decided it was cheaper not to buy electricity and pay Enron the mandatory fixed charges specified in the contract.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12337</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This means that the government of one of the poorest countries in the world was paying Enron 220 million US dollars a year not to produce electricity!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12338</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now that Enron has ceased to exist, Bechtel and GE are suing the Indian Government for 5.6 billion US dollars.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12339</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is not even a minute fraction of the sum of money that they (or Enron ) actually invested in the project.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12340</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Once more, it's a projection of profit they would have made had the project materialized.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12341</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For a slightly different perspective:</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12342</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"Maharashtra officials say the cost of power supplied by Enron is nearly double the tariff charged by Indian power producers, and used it as an excuse to stop paying state debts to the plant. "</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12343</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"Enron had signed a power purchase agreement with power utility MSEB eight years ago, under which a $3bn 2,182 Megawatt power plant was to be commissioned.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12344</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But the project ran into trouble nearly two years ago with the Indian authorities beginning to delay payments saying Enron's power tariff was too high...Though Enron officials refuse to talk about the price they would be willing to sell their stake at, analysts say the US company is demanding about one billion dollars for its investments in India.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12345</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So far it has only got offers of about half that amount from Indian companies and financial institutions, but Enron is unwilling to sell its stake at a price lower than the cost.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12346</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In case no satisfactory offer comes from the Indian side, Enron will have little option but to go for international arbitration as their investments in the country were guaranteed by the Indian Government.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12347</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But arbitration proceedings can be a long and messy affair.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12348</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Analysts say both India and Enron have little to gain from a protracted legal battle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12349</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The best way out could be a compromise by which Enron gets less than what it is demanding and more than what the Indians are presently offering.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12350</DOCNO>
<TEXT>IOW: No fraud, just a basic business dispute, in which the party reneging on its obligations is the gov't of Maharashtra.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12351</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Maharashtra officials are either incompetent fools, or worse- malicious fraudsters who conned an international comapny into building a state-of-the-art power plant for them at a cost of billions of dollars, and then refused payment, knowing the company has no legal recourse except lengthy international arbitration, and will likely sell the plant to them for a fraction of its true value.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>12423</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I hear discussion along the lines that the United States was *wanting* to go to war with Japan, and had been trying to bring that about for years.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>12424</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Any recognized books that develop this thesis; is there a definitive work?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12425</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>(stuff deleted)</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12427</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12428</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One of their "proofs" was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack, and "everybody knew" carriers were the capital ship of the future.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12429</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12430</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Even stranger, the USS Enterprise was scheduled to be at Pearl by Dec 6th, but got delayed by a storm.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12431</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12432</DOCNO>
<TEXT>To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Here's something I wrote as part of a larger article, some while ago:</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12434</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Wasn't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12435</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being "driven into a corner" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack the US.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12436</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Meiji Japan was driven to emulate what it thought the West was doing in every facet of society.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12437</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They had observed, for example, that the West was able to carve up China into "Spheres of Influence", and was able to do from great distances, while they, the Japanese, had had limited success in their previous attempts to dominate the Korean peninsula, much less China.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12438</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As part of the catch-up effort, she whole-heartedly entered into the Imperialist game in Asia, being treated as an equal (relative to her power) by the other powers.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12439</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, after World War I, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in addition to outright stopping all expansions.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12440</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Japan chose to read this as a sign that the West had lost its power and resolve, and that Japan was the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in Asia.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12441</DOCNO>
<TEXT>With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12444</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The reality of this was that only a single possession, Manchuria, was profitable to the Japanese, and the rest of the Empire turned out to be a drain.</TEXT>

<DOC>

<TEXT>This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion of China proper in 1936.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12446</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12447</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal and fuel.)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce, and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic industry.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>12451</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Japan expanded into areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area; possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue their fight against Hitler.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>12452</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At this point, the US stopped ignoring the Japanese threat, and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on Japan, cutting off her scrap metal, limitting and then cutting off her oil (Japan imported most of both from the US.)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Many careless observers felt at the time that the success of Lincoln was due entirely to the fact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field; or, in other words, to the dissensions in the Democratic party, which divided its vote between Breckinridge and Douglas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If all the votes given to all the opposing candidates had been concentrated and cast for a 'fusion ticket,' as was wholly or partly done in five States, the result would have been changed nowhere except in New Jersey, California, and Oregon; Lincoln would still have received but 11 fewer, or 169 electoral votes--majority of 35 in the entire electoral college."</TEXT>

<TEXT>See for a confirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got an abolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon, California, and New Jersey) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the Electoral College.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12480</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was divided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in ten southern states he got no popular votes at all.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12481</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti-Lincoln opposition might have done better than all the OTL anti-Lincoln candidates combined, because the mere fact of the divided nature of Lincoln's opposition might have discouraged anti-Lincoln men and led to fewer of them voting than would otherwise be the case.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>12553</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm simply trying to get some perspective.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12554</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Holocaust of the Jews and Zigeuner was motivated by racial prejudices.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12555</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The murder of (at the most) 10k homosexuals wasn't.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12556</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were imprisoned in normal jails.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12557</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If you were homosexually oriented but did nothing with it the law in 30s Germany couldn't touch you.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12558</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Jews and Zigeuner on the other hand were killed simply for their ontological state.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12565</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think the chance of their being only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were killed in the camps is rather small.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12566</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of homosexuality during the Nazi rule, finding out how many were sent to a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their sentence, but 10-15k seems reasonable</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people convene, to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning (emphasis added): Britain's gun laws are aimed at the wrong target, curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing to tackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years, according to an international firearms legislation expert.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12587</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of the law-abiding community where gun crimes, such as the Dunblane massacre, were aberrations .</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12588</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12589</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12590</DOCNO>
<TEXT>His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a day in England and Wales, more than twice the level of when the Labour Government came to power in 1997 .</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12591</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In the past two years, there have been cases of schoolchildren and a baby, killed or injured by guns.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12592</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"I believe that factors of political correctness are at work," he said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12593</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12594</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Prof Mauser added: "The sad truth is that while the police officers are inspecting farmers' gun cabinets to see if they comply with regulations somewhere in the UK, someone, who has not filled in a firearms certificate form, will be smuggling a gun into the country or selling one to an inner city youth."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12595</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to June .</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12596</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birmingham and Manchester.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I haven't remarked on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people dead, and why I haven't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12601</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12602</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is problem that needs to be addressed.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12603</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But as for the assault weapons ban issue, the man accused of the brutal killings, Chai Vang of St. Paul, Minn, used a Russian-built Saiga 7.62 mm, SKS semiautomatic rifle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12604</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain "assault weapons" signed by President Clinton.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12605</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The ban expired in September and at the time of this posting, no one has been killed by any one of those weapons since the ban expired.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12606</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But let's talk about this case, as I'm sure discussions have started and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12607</DOCNO>
<TEXT>While the media use words like "military style," "assault" and "semiautomatic," the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typical hunting rifle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12608</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12609</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an "assault" weapon.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12610</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk about the person behind the trigger.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12611</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If convicted of the killings, Vang faces life in prison as Minnesota does not honor the death penalty.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>12612</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I look forward to Vang's conviction and I pray for the families of the victims.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Gotta say that this shocked me, I've always thought Mr. Baker was a upstanding guy but this is just plain good old fashioned bullcrap.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13185</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist Marwan Barghouti Marwan Barghouti (born June 6, 1958) is a Palestinian leader from the West Bank and a leader of the Fatah movement that forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13186</DOCNO>
<TEXT>On June 6, 2004, he was sentenced to five life sentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 years imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13187</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Barghouti was one of the major leaders of the First Intifada in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13188</DOCNO>
<TEXT>During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to Jordan, where he stayed for seven years until he was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13189</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In 1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which he advocated peace with Israel, sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser Arafat.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13190</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The formal position occupied by Barghouti was the General Secretary of Fatah in the West Bank.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13191</DOCNO>
<TEXT>By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at odds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration of corruption and his security services of human rights violations, and Arafat was planning to fire him shortly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13192</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, as the Second Intifada began, Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13193</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This was perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens of civilian deaths in drive-by shootings.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13194</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Under Barghouti, the Tanzim has also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I found the following report that was presented to Congress recently about the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this might very well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on the threat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), pose to commercial airliners.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13247</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Most believe that no single solution exists to effectively mitigate this threat.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13248</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Instead, a menu of options may be considered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures on aircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic control procedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengthening missile non-proliferation efforts.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13249</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating in areas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasible to implement.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13250</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, this option has a relatively high cost, between $1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed for implementation does not allow for immediate response to the existing terrorist threat.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13251</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Procedural improvements such as specific flight crew training, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to the threat, and improved security near airports may be less costly than countermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attacks.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13252</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, these techniques by themselves cannot completely mitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S. airliners flying to and from foreign airports.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From a European perspective, three things are making it easier to warm to the Bush White House.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13263</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One is the death of Yasser Arafat.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13264</DOCNO>
<TEXT>No issue divides Europe and the United States more keenly than the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13265</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For the last few years, Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for refusing to deal with Arafat.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>13266</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That another reason why I respect Bush so much, his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>13267</DOCNO>
<TEXT>May he rot in hell.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13268</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian leader.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13269</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A second reason is Europe's growing worries about Islamic terrorism.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker, at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe's 9/11.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13271</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable, it is certainly true that American conservatives, such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis, have found a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of history: that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13282</DOCNO>
<TEXT>His thumping re-election, however, shows that he represents a large body of conservative American opinion.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13283</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In short, Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush who is the exception, but the U.S. itself that is exceptional --- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mischie in jail</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13288</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Nicolae Mischie, authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party, has been jailed.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13289</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Romania voted in the last December, ousting the so-called socialist party PSD (Social-Democratic Party).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13290</DOCNO>
<TEXT>PSD managed to keep a stronghold in poor rural areas, with the help of people like Mischie.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13291</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They combined blackmail, using their right of decision regarding the public funds for local leaders opposing PSD, and strong seduction of the uneducated masses, in a marvelous way.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13292</DOCNO>
<TEXT>E.g., Mischie, who talks like an idiot, got a PhD in history.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13293</DOCNO>
<TEXT>His paper was on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie bought the house where his paper's subject lived.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13294</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Maybe he tried to invest in his paper, maybe he believed sincerely in his admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and his ability of earning PhDs, but using a big car and living in a big house are signs for the masses that the man is an invaluable and irreplaceable leader.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13295</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Another misleading sign was his position as a University professor - he was teaching mostly at private universities, which are still ways to buy diplomas here in Romania.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13296</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Local leaders did their jobs, but national leaders, pressuring TV stations to lie, associating with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu, failed to win in big cities.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13297</DOCNO>
<TEXT>PSD is building a strategy for the 4 years to come and they are going to elect a leader.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13298</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is known that communist leaders die in office (as judges of the U.S. Supreme Court) and Ion Iliescu won't be different.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13299</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All the leaders that expressed different points of view will be excluded from the party, that's the untold truth that Romanian media seem to hide or not conceive yet.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13300</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Mischie was right to criticize the national leaders, because PSD got a good share in the elections in his area.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13301</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But Mischie was wrong, because he did that while in vacation in Switzerland, where you can't go if you earn 20K $ a year.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>13302</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The new power had nothing to do, but let the policemen do what they should be doing years ago.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13303</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Iliescu and Nastase, ex-president and ex-prime minister, are now left only with the leadership of the party and holding this illusory authority.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>The interim government declared a state of emergency in Iraq excluding the Kurdish region for 60 days, according to the National Security Law introduced last August which states that emergency laws can be declared in the country for a period no more than 60 days provided a serious threat against Iraqi national security is recognised by the interim government.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A full-scale military operation against Fallujah, which is apparently underway already, seems to be the government's 'final solution'.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not optimistic to the outcome, especially when significant civilian casualties are unavoidable.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>Note, that I'm not suggesting a peaceful or political solution would work either in these areas.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>Insurgents west of Baghdad have quite obstinately made it clear that nothing but full control of the country, or at least the Anbar governorate, will satisfy them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13319</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They have refused to participate in the political process, they have repeatedly announced their intentions to boycott the elections and to disrupt them in other areas, and they do not recognise the government or any other authority in the country beside themselves.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13320</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The demands of the Fallujah negotiants from the government weeks ago were obscene and they clearly reflect the overt sectarianism and regionalism of the armed groups in the area.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13321</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The demands were not released to the Iraqi public at the time for unkown reasons but they have leaked out days ago.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13322</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Here are just a few of them:</TEXT>

<TEXT>-Incomes of Shi'ite sacred shrines should be returned under the control of the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>Auburn's Quentin Groves and Georgia's David Pollack are tied for the SEC sack lead.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13438</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Here's the biggest for what it's worth stat as far as I am concerned: both teams are undefeated this year when scoring first.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13439</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Auburn is 8-0 and UGA is 5-0.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13440</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'd say that's the biggest stat right now.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13441</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Auburn's offense is potent and efficient.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Auburn's defense is fast and relentless and the DB's are experienced and big.</TEXT>

<TEXT>UGA's receivers are leaders, with one of them a team captain.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13445</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Auburn's two running backs are seniors and very experienced and dangerous, bruising backs.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>UGA's two backs are smaller freshmen with less experience, but are dangerous as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>13447</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In my mind, the game is going to turn on a few key points, some obvious and some not.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13448</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Here goes the prediction machine:</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13449</DOCNO>
<TEXT>- Turnovers (as always) will be critical.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13450</DOCNO>
<TEXT>- Special teams play and lack of special teams mistakes will tell the tale regarding field position.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13451</DOCNO>
<TEXT>- Both teams MUST establish the run to be successful.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13452</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If Auburn goes for 150 between their two backs, they're almost impossible to beat.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13453</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Conversely, Georgia MUST be able to run the ball to set up play action and keep the pressure off of David Greene.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13454</DOCNO>
<TEXT>- Mark Richt has proven to be a better on the fly adjustment coach that Tommy Tuberville.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13455</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Tubs is famous for taking chances, often unnecessary ones.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13456</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That history is of concern to me.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13457</DOCNO>
<TEXT>While it's okay to try crazy shit when your team is under-rated or a serious underdog, it's important not to give games away when you're the favorite.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13458</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Playing more "by the book" and a bit "closer to the vest" becomes the call for the day.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13459</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Considering all of these factors, I truly believe that this is Auburn's year.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13460</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They may not go undefeated and they may not get into the BCS title game, but they have enough talent, poise and experience to win this game.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13461</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Auburn wins 31-21.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13477</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All the talk for the weeks leading up to the game was about "if Bama's undefeated, they'll play for it all in the Sugar Bowl" and other crap like that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13478</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, "if or when" never happened because Auburn won 30-20 in one of the greatest Iron Bowl games ever, putting an end to Bama's national title hopes for the year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Suddenly, I'm about nauseous about this game too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Has all of the bluster and talking shown up on The Plains as well?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jail time, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what she stole.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, it's mid-morning on the East coast and I am sitting here running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what's going to happen in the Iron Bowl, which is just over 29 hours away.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13505</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The game is being played in Tuscaloosa, which should be an advantage to Alabama.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13506</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, In the two times the game has been played in Bryant Denny Stadium, Auburn has won.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13507</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Alabama has one of the stingiest defenses in the country, and were ranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13508</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Conversely, Auburn has one of the most potent and balanced offensive attacks in the nation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13509</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Also, I don't think Bama has faced an attack with two great runners, a great line, a poised QB and good receivers and a tight end as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13510</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Bama is missing it's starting offensive backfield from the start of the season.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13511</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The fact that they've won six games is a testament to the coaching and heart of the players.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13512</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Alabama simply cannot throw the football, which is a good thing, because Auburn's defensive backfield is second to none.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Bama can run the ball however.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13514</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Unfortunately for them, with no passing game to keep the defense honest, Auburn will probably stack nine in the box, play man on the corners, and dare Bama to run, and I don't think they'll be able to do it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13515</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Auburn is also 9-0 when they score first.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13516</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Tuberville way is to get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you're at home and to quiet the other team's crowd if you're on the road.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>13517</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13518</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In this exact game 15 years ago, Bama came into Auburn #2 in the country, undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another national championship.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score was closer than the actual game.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That could very well happen Saturday.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I always tell people that the Georgia game matters more to me than the Bama game.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13522</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I live in Georgia, and losing that game affects me much more directly than losing the Alabama game.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13523</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That said, when kickoff time comes, you remember all the reasons that you hate Alabama and their dumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and their houndstooth hats and their "Bear this" and "Bear that," and everything else that goes along with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all, I want to congratulate the Auburn Football team for doing what no other Auburn football team has done; going 12-0.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13585</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They also won their first outright SEC title since 1987 and won their first SEC title since the conference implimented the Championship game format.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13586</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A year ago, the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorly executed plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and too empowered booster with a fat checkbook.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13587</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Since that day, the team is undefeated and has won 14 games in a row.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13588</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They have now beated four teams that were in the top 15 at the time the games were played, and two of those games were won away from Jordan-Hare Stadium.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13589</DOCNO>
<TEXT>On championship weekend, the big three all played.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13590</DOCNO>
<TEXT>USC won by five over a shitty UCLA team with a 6-5 record, and that was thanks in part to an official who blew dead a clear and obvious fumble that would have been returned for a UCLA touchdown.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13591</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Oklahoma played in it's conference title game against a four-loss Colorado team that can't throw the ball.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13592</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The result was a 40 plus point beatdown, but what did anyone expect?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13593</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Auburn played 15th ranked Tennessee and was attempting to do one of the toughest things to do in college football: beating a team twice in the same year.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13594</DOCNO>
<TEXT>With the exception of a 15 yard shanked punt and a punt snap that Kody Bliss missed while having an apparent thrombosis, Auburn led 21-7 at the half and had held UT to 46 yards of offense.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13595</DOCNO>
<TEXT>While the Auburn running game was held up, Jason Campbell threw it all over the ball field and, when his receivers were covered, he ran for yardage on his own.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13596</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his knees and ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of good sportsmanship.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13597</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled a touchdown, since the ball clearly touched the turf, and that's where the momentum of the game changed.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13598</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think it was also at that point that the scoreboard began to reflect Auburn's last title hopes dying as the Oklahoma-Colorado score would have begun showing the beat-down that was occuring.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13599</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Auburn was tied 21-21 and in jeapordy of losing it most important game ever, but senior QB Jason Campbell would have none of it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13600</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Auburn won going away 38-28, and the only place the game looked close was on the scoreboard.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13601</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I can't believe that an undefeated SEC team is not playing for a title, but I guess we can thank Jeff Sagarin and the other dicks that keep voting USC number one to make up for what happened to them last year.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13602</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All I know is that they better think that way next year, because it's Auburn that got screwed this year.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13603</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And what's better is that Auburn gets to play one of the three hottest teams in the country in my opinion.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13604</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Virginia Tech is talented, very athletic and one of the most well coached teams in the country and they WILL come to play on January 3rd.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13605</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I hope our kids can shake off this travesty and focus on making the pollsters look like idiots.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13606</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Maybe an Oklahoma win in a butt-ugly game and a great Auburn performance could help.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13607</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What's the definition of pragmatic?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13608</DOCNO>

<TEXT>So get this...</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13611</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm reading ESPN this morning when I stumbled across the story where Kobe Bryant said he'd like to sit down with Shaq and apologize to him for "involving him in my troubles."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13612</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Bryant also says that he thinks December 25th "sounds like a good day to me to kind of talk to him and tell him I never meant in any kind of way to bring any of his personal business out."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13613</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You see, after Kobe's world fell apart because he couldn't resist banging the crazy white towel clerk at his hotel, he needed an out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13614</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He bought his wife a four million dollar ring and got some tattoos that said how much he loved her, but he needed to do more to attract attention away from himself.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13615</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So he told the media that he should have done what Shaq always did, just pay the women to shut up.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13616</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Kobe also alleged that O'neal had paid upwards of one million dollars in this way as hush money over the years.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13617</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Shaq has denied it from the beginning, but that's not really the point.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13618</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's no secret that a large number of the NBA's "stars" are not exactly star-worthy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13619</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Good players or not, guys like Kemp and Bryant and Iverson and the entire Blazers team are just not very nice or good people.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13620</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the league will tolerate it, what do I care?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13621</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But the real issue is this.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13622</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Kobe's Lakers will play Shaq's Miami Heat on...that's right...December 25th.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13623</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So the real motivation for Kobe here is not to mend fences or admit he was wrong to involve any other person in his own little pit of woe.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13624</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is to find some sort of way to keep the 340-pound Shaquille and his teammates from beating the ever-loving shit out of Kobe for 48 pain-filled minutes on Christmas Day.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13625</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I can't tell you the number of ways that Kobe Bryant makes me sick.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13626</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Despite his slick talk and his nice diction, he's nothing but a cheater and a liar and a punk.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13627</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I hardly watch any NBA games because the league and most of it's players sicken me, but I've had December 25th circled on my calendar since the day after Shaq signed with the Heat.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13628</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's the day that Shaq will take a million dollars or more out of Kobe's punk-ass.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13629</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It ain't much...</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13630</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Sorry I haven't been posting much lately.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13631</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We have been so damned busy with the holidays (that's what we call December at our house) that I just haven't had time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13632</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I read a funny joke today and I thought I'd share it with you.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13633</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One of my fellow eggers posted it, so Chet, here's your credit:</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13634</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A traveler was driving through Arkansas when he lost his way and got off the main highway.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13635</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As he drove by, he saw rows and rows of pigsties and pigpens and pigs running in fields and pigs wallowing in mud.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13636</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Suddenly, his eye caught something really strange.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13637</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He did a double take, muttered to himself and then looked a third time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13638</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He wondered if he had seen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13639</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He found the lane to the farm and drove up into the farmyard, where he was met by the farmer.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13640</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"Excuse me," the traveler said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13641</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"I was just driving by and looking at all your pigs, and I noticed something that I just had to stop and ask about.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13642</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Tell me, did I see right?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13643</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg?"</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13644</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The farmer smiled.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13645</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"Oh, that would be old Caesar you saw.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13646</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He's the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - and smart!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13647</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, let me tell you a little about that pig.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13648</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You see that barge down there on the river?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13649</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now that dredge brings me in about $120,000 every year.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13650</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"There's another thing, too, a little more personal.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13651</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One night a couple of years ago I got to drinking and I guess I had more than I should have.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13652</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I passed out drunk, fell down and knocked over a lamp.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13653</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That started a fire in the house and old Caesar smelled the smoke.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13654</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He came in the back door, got the wife and kid out, roused me up and got me out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13655</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"There is no question about it - that night old Caesar saved all our lives and you know that is not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13656</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"Why," the traveler said, "this is all amazing!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13657</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I have never heard of a pig like this before!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13658</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is fantastic!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13659</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But tell me, how did he get that wooden leg?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13660</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Was he in a wreck or something?"</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13661</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The farmer laughed and said, "Well, naturally, when you have a pig that smart, you don't want to eat him all at one time!"</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13662</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Did anyone see the Packers game Sunday?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13663</DOCNO>
<TEXT>While it was entertaining, that's not why I'm posting about it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13664</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I don't normally post about pro football, but what I saw deserved a ranting or two, and I suspect it's going to get many more in the days and weeks to come.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13665</DOCNO>
<TEXT>With 4:41 left in the fourth quarter and the Packers down by 11, Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash marks.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13666</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13667</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Remarkably, Ferguson held on to the ball, despite being disjoined from his helmet on the hit.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13668</DOCNO>
<TEXT>After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson was finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the way out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13669</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The Packers went on to lose the game, but that's not the story here.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13670</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in professional wrestling broadcasts.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13671</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This was a vicious, arm cocked and swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off of his body.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13672</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The play was immediately flagged, and moments later it was announced that Darius had been ejected, much to the crowd's delight.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13673</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left the field.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13674</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It would have been easy to bathe him in beer or snowballs or batteries as he left, but the Packer fans are classier than that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13675</DOCNO>
<TEXT>To a person, they acted with class, using their voices and not projectiles to express their displeasure.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13676</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's about five seconds after he had released a pass.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13677</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio and Darius had the nerve to vociferously argue with officials about Darius' ejection from the game.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13678</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13679</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Darius' intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13680</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The more I saw the replay, the sicker it made me feel.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13681</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The league must take action, and it must be swift and sure.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13682</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm talking about a four game suspension that included the playoffs if necessary.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13683</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In this day and age of bigger, stronger and faster players, injuries are going to happen accidentally all of the time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13684</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There is simply no room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson's injury.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13685</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this will not be tolerated.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13686</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Maybe that will tell the Jaguars, Darius and players like him that this kind of head-hunting will not be tolerated in the NFL.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13687</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle this matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similar attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman.</TEXT>

<TEXT>On one hand, I am a bit sad because years like this only happen for Auburn every 15 or 20 years, so it's a little disappointing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>On the other hand, this worked out about as well as it could.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>If you asked me at the beginning of the year if I'd rather be 8-3 and playing in the liberty bowl or 12-0 with a chance to win the Sugar Bowl, go 13-0 and finish second, I'd say hell yeah to the latter.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13724</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The fact that pundits put OU ahead of Auburn based on their out of conference schedule being tougher than ours is laughable now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Meanwhile, Auburn fans can spend the next six months saying "yeah, but we'd have done this" or "We were 13-0, won the sec, beat five top ten teams, three of them on the road, and became the only undefeated SEC team in the BCS's history to NOT play for the title."</TEXT>

<TEXT>Then, all current contracts need to be voided by the end of the season in 2006.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13795</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13830</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There's plenty of argument about the future of DVD and video rental, and Netflix represents a pure-play on one of the three dominant hypotheses:</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13831</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view, video-on-demand, pirated movies, high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts, and the increasing availability of other media, it takes some faith to see any future for movie rentals.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13832</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Those who don't have the requisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13833</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films; they're the stodgy, expensive way.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>There aren't any pure-play buys on this theory, but someone who believes it might overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any media stocks at all.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13858</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13862</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They have many of the symptoms of a late-stage conglomerate: A gigantic main business with slowing growth, fear that competition will substantially reduce the profitability of their main business, a shareholder base that includes many people who own only WalMart stock (thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification), and enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13863</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I can understand the concerns, but I don't see the motivation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13864</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As a retailer of just about everything, WalMart can expand into some pretty broadly-defined areas without going beyond either their core competencies or some arenas where they can cut costs.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13865</DOCNO>

<TEXT>Back in the day (2000-2003 or so) some of the hottest non-homebuilding stocks were the gaming equipment manufacturers , who rode a wave of heavy reinvestment in casinos to produce huge profits.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13938</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Most of the profit decline was because Vioxx, representing about 11% of sales, now represents a pretty severe legal headache: Not only have they lost the revenue, but they've taken a $600 million charge as a reserve against future Vioxx losses.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13974</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The rhetoric we're hearing -- that Marsh may have cost customers billions of dollars -- doesn't match the reality that in a few cases, they manipulated bids, but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollars of business priced 5% or 10% higher than it otherwise would have been.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Interesting terminology...</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>13986</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I believe they're referring to the budget deficit and... the capital surplus?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13987</DOCNO>
<TEXT>When analyzing trade deficits, it's important to realize that the amount by which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign investors have bet on the US.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13988</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So the trade deficit is due to a confluence of the pressures from US consumers (who control about 20% of global GDP) and everybody else (excluding the non-consumption share of US GDP, that would amount to around 75% of global GDP).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13989</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Which of those is -- probably -- going to be a more important number?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13990</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported goods, the largest pressure on the deficit is that we're simply a better place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they face.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13991</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And what about that other deficit?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13992</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It, of course, is the ominous sum that we fund without taxes, but by borrowing funds.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13993</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And about half of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>13994</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So, not to be a heretic, but 1) We're issuing them at relatively low interest rates, 2) Inflation is bound to pick up eventually, and so 3) Wouldn't you rather have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by non-US investors, rather than raising taxes in America?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Gmail: Cachet for Everybody!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14023</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At first, I was pretty skeptical of Gmail -- an announcement of something new, cool, and free, from a quirky company, on April Fool's Day?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14024</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Turns out my initial attitude wasn't justified, of course, and Gmail has been a popular success.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14025</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Just this weekend, Google gave many users another fifty invitations , prompting some to speculate that it could be the start of Gmail's final move out of beta.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14026</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Their marketing was absolutely brilliant: Simply through association with Google, and because of the invitation-only membership, they created a product with instant cachet -- something so in demand invitations went for $50 on eBay, and one enterprising site even offered a kidney for an invite.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14027</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And now?</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14028</DOCNO>

<DOCNO>14034</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Frenetic merger and acquisition activity doesn't mean much in the early days of a business -- it's just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startups are buying out their bankrupt competitors to create larger and less stable conglomerates as it is that forward-thinking visionaries are cutting off their competitors early.</TEXT>

<TEXT>And tonight, Cisco reported solid earnings and weak sales .</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14046</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The market's modestly pessimistic reaction to the Bloglines news tells us that blogging isn't seen as a major profit source yet; tomorrow's trading will tell us whether the market is ready to accept that more established technology businesses are back on track as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14047</DOCNO>
<TEXT>After hours, Cisco's been slammed, but once they're exposed to the rest of the trading population, the results might differ.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14048</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I don't think bloglines will ever be a major source of profits or revenues.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14049</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Blogging itself could become a pretty big consumer past time like watching TV, reading a book, or playing video games but I am not sure how bloglines really benefits.</TEXT>

<TEXT>And everyone can be reasonably happy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14071</DOCNO>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14074</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The iPod's the tiniest possible container for vast music libraries, and Sirius is a way to get at lots of content when said music library is unavailable.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>On the other hand, Karmazin and Jobs are two of the smartest dealmakers around, so they might find a way to structure this or spin it to the benefit of everyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>He once showed up at an investment seminar dressed as Moses, wearing a crown and carrying tablets.</TEXT>

</DOC>

<DOCNO>14115</DOCNO>
<TEXT>With Greenspan's unspoken position as economic czar, that's what we have right now: a benevolent dictatorship of the Fed.</TEXT>
</DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14127</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So I'll just note that I don't see it as quite so black-and-white, and I think some of the compromises (like reducing taxes for parents, on the grounds that children are the assets backing Social Security) might be useful and -- we are dealing with a win-or-lose, vote-or-not situation -- practical.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The amount in question: $37 million.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14133</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14134</DOCNO>

<TEXT>These insider sales were certainly stupid, and probably criminal (though the legal proof may be hard to come by) but the solution is easy enough: They need to buy stock from the company itself, at some premium to the prices at which they sold -- they'll have the same stake as before, the shareholders would have gotten their money back (since the premium goes to the company, which is owned by the shareholders), and there's no need to disrupt their business by taking the matter to court.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Southern states considering higher cigarette taxes?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14168</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Good plan; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states, inasmuch as the states are caretakers for plenty of people who are ill thanks to cigarettes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14169</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What's notable in this debate, however, is that according to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the tax by noting that "While North Carolina's excise tax is only 5 cents, the total taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61 cents per pack."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14170</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots of money to the states, that's technically accurate.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14171</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But the point of these taxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society, and inasmuch as these penalties aren't assessed on a per-pack basis, they don't -- they're a lump-sum reflection of the taxes these companies ought to have paid before.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14172</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Interestingly, the policy of making cigarette buyers pay to compensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatable synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unless they pay full cost.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14173</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They're basically buying future medical care throughout their lives, rather than eventually making the (healthy) remainder of the populace pay up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>You'd think he was busy enough with Blockbuster and Hollywood , but Carl Icahn is once again going after Mylan labs .</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14177</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'd love to call it a classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14178</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But the whole point of raiding is to outsmart an opponent, and that means the strategy changes constantly.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14179</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In this case, the most interesting twist is that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't acquire.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14180</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In 1994, I was a graduate student in Boston.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>14187</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I was asked to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14188</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The conference was being held by a new group called Students for Responsible Business.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14189</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I expected to see a small gathering of idealistic, slightly naive MBA students.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14190</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What I found was a packed room of 200 intelligent, practical,driven idealists.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14191</DOCNO>
<TEXT>These students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14192</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I left that room with my eyes open to the possibilities presented by these future business leaders.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>14193</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Fast forward 10 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Students for Responsible Business is now called Net Impact .</TEXT>

<TEXT>In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend their conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14196</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14197</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14198</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The buzz words flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship, sustainable profitability, working with passion.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14199</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I met student after student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to improve the world.</TEXT>

<TEXT>These students understand that business is a powerful lever of change in this world.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>Recently business schools have received their share of criticism for turning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of their responsibility for ethical action.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14202</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I can tell you that I am seeing a powerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14203</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is not coming from the faculty, or the alumni, or the administration.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14204</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student experiences.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The change is being demanded by the students.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>14206</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A little secret of business schools is that MBA students have an immense amount of sway.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14207</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Few choose to use it, but if they want they can fundamentally change their school.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14208</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Right now students at business schools are asking for more discussion of these topics in classes, are initiating service projects, forming support group for social entrepreneurs, inviting speakers to campus to discuss sustainability, social investing, non-profit innovations, etc.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14209</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Net Impact is often at the center of these efforts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>These are not isolated events...This is a revolution from within.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<DOCNO>14219</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But on the subject of succession, those two look like role models compared with insurance giant American International Group Inc. ( AIG ), whose aging CEO has no plans to retire.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14220</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, who turns 80 in May, groomed two sons to be successors, but both have since left AIG.Greenberg Sr. then created an office of the chairman in 2002, which includes co-COOs Martin J. Sullivan and Donald P. Kanak.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14221</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Both are considered possible successors, but the board won't know Greenberg's preference until his departure, when it opens a sealed letter.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14222</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Perhaps this is a good time for a quick refresher....</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14223</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The CEO works for the board ...end lesson.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14224</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I guess it is not as straight forward when your CEO is also chairman and one of the largest shareholders.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14225</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It would be tempting to get on my high horse right now about the need to separate the positions of CEO and Chairman but to be honest with you I don't really believe that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14226</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I know CEO/chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14227</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14228</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Having a combined CEO/Chairman does reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14229</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This downside of having a combined CEO/chair is offset by (1) a reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the organization and (2) an increase in the negotiating position of the CEO when dealing with suppliers, potential merger partners, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In a study published in the Journal of Business Finance & Accounting (2003, 30:771-798), Greg Filbeck and Dianna Preece found that companies on the Fortune list of 100 Best Companies to Work For outperformed a matched sample of firms along multiple measures of return.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>14253</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This study is particularly relevant for investors because the authors measured return after the list was announced.</TEXT>

<TEXT>To often these studies use as a starting point the moment before information becomes public.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14319</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That is true but not very revealing wouldn't you say?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14320</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Evidence is mixed mostly because (1) there is little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and (2) many current measures toss together a heap of information that has no business being lumped together.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14321</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Social responsibility often includes everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14322</DOCNO>
<TEXT>There is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14323</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yet both get lumped together in the socially responsible investing discussion.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14324</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various components, you start to see the valuable information.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14325</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Companies that have poor employee relations tend to underperform, as do companies that pollute at a higher rate than their industry peers.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14326</DOCNO>
<TEXT>On the other hand, companies with numerous NLRB violations don't do worse than their peers and companies that sell your typical "sin" products (tobacco, firearms, gambling) can be excellent investments.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14327</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Lump all these things together and of course you will get mixed results.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14328</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Taken separately, they provide valuable information about future firm performance.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14329</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I guess it is time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalist vs. hippie tree hugger in this discussion.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>14341</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Hard to say.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14342</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Both companies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based on optimistic expectations of future growth.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14343</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yesterday's news led many to question their growth assumptions for these companies.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14344</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14345</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think I have to start by acknowledging that the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14346</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level of business risk .</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14347</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This may partially justify a higher P/E ratio.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14348</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A couple weeks ago, I observed that Wal-Mart had offsetting strong and weak organizational indicators .</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14349</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Starbucks, on the other hand, has uniformly strong organizational indicators.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14350</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Starbucks scores as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicators.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14351</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Not surprising are its strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actions indicators.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14352</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Its weakest score is in the external reporting indicator.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14353</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In the past, several observers have raised concerns about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematic current issues.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14354</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The weak score is primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreign subsidiaries.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14355</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is a strategic shift that has short-term costs and adds some uncertainty to the financial statements.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14356</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis, several additional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14357</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Starbucks has little debt.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14358</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Starbucks is not currently financing its growth with debt.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14359</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Considering its growth, this is amazing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14360</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It also means that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how it finances future growth.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14361</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The company can assume much more debt without negatively affecting its risk profile because...</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14362</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14363</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This allows the company to grow without debt.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14364</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You could argue that Starbucks has too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14365</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This option is another way that Starbucks has retained its flexibility for the future.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14366</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limits franchising.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14367</DOCNO>
<TEXT>While Starbucks does partner (airlines, airports, Barnes & Noble), most of its stores are company owned.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14368</DOCNO>
<TEXT>From a managerial perspective this greatly simplifies cost structures, product changes, and quality control.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14369</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company with a very strong future.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14370</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I cannot say if these factors justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P/E ratio than the industry norm.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14371</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Risk is lower.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14372</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Interesting aside: Starbucks is taking over the location in my town that was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>14388</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Another one of your leading questions.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14389</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is a medical malpractice crisis.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14390</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence, hundred of thousands are injured.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14391</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14392</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14393</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But if you take the entire amount of premiums, Bob, that's paid by doctors in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14394</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14395</DOCNO>
<TEXT>That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving their practice because they can't afford it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14396</DOCNO>
<TEXT>You know, Ralph, you and I often agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14398</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Well, as much as they've poured into those coffers, it's much less than what the doctors, the malpractice insurers, the hospital chains and the HMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress' coffers.</TEXT>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14436</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And the system in California that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5, that's a system that has worked.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14437</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It brought stability to California and obstetricians in California will pay 55, 57, $60,000 in Los Angeles and in South Florida in Miami, they'll pay $210,000...(CROSSTALK)</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14438</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premium levels.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14439</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And in Florida, they've been very weak on it.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14490</DOCNO>
<TEXT>What I found interesting was the contrast in reactions to Ebbin from two colleagues: "I suppose that one of the concerns was that since he is the only openly gay member of the Legislature, is whether or not that would be the only issue that he would ... talk about," said Del.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Richard Black, R-Loudoun, who has compiled a track record as one of the most socially conservative members of the state legislature and was the sponsor of the gay adoption bill, said he's not trying to stamp out gay rights but is simply trying to preserve tradition.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14495</DOCNO>
<TEXT>As for his personal feelings on Ebbin, after a lengthy pause, the Loudoun Republican offered: "He's always prompt and, you know, on time to meetings."</TEXT>

<TEXT>A moment later, he added, "I think he works hard."</TEXT>

<TEXT>Joe had just read a George W. Grayson article in the William & Mary Alumni Magazine , " Myths About Illegal Immigration ."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14510</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Grayson does not cite any Virginia examples, but among the "myths" he attempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs Americans don't want and that they contribute more in taxes and social security than they take from government programs.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>I personally know a good number of immigrants, both legal and illegal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One fellow, a Brazilian, has done everything by the book.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He gets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands of dollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service... not to mention, he's paying the government thousands in taxes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14514</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He gets very frustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under the table.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14515</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They aren't paying lawyers, and they pay nothing into the system.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14516</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Of course, the Americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to pay in cash because it means cheaper labor for them.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14517</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Who benefits?</TEXT>

<DOCNO>14518</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The illegal immigrants themselves, of course.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>The employers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native-born Americans and legal immigrants.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>And families who hire cheap domestic labor, whether to clean the house, wash the laundry or maintain the lawn.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14521</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Who loses?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14522</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Poor, native-born Americans who otherwise would be paid higher wages for their manual labor.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14523</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Legal immigrants like my Brazilian friend, who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14524</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And the rest of us who won't hire anyone to work for us unless they're paying their taxes, even if it means we pay more.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14525</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yeah, I've got a problem with turning around and giving illegal immigrants all the rights and privileges of the native born and the legal immigrants who've played by the rules.</TEXT>

<TEXT>she says there is an acknowledgment from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in baghdad to control what our nic robertson is saying is a stage of anarchy in some parts of iraq.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14587</DOCNO>
<TEXT>do you think the administration underestimated the day after?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14588</DOCNO>
<TEXT>i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14589</DOCNO>
<TEXT>i think that there's been a pattern here not just with this administration, but over the last ten years, bosnia, kosovo, afghanistan, where we don't quite recognize when the old order collapses, you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14590</DOCNO>
<TEXT>in the short-term, that's going to have to mean the american military.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14591</DOCNO>
<TEXT>but the key question, which i try to address in the book, is what do you do after that?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14592</DOCNO>
<TEXT>what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14593</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or, in fact, interested in democracy?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14594</DOCNO>
<TEXT>there's no proof of that.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14595</DOCNO>
<TEXT>well, the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good is to hold elections.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14596</DOCNO>
<TEXT>but if you hold elections, you stop the whole process of building a rule of law, creating courts, creating administration.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14597</DOCNO>
<TEXT>we've seen in the past in bosnia for example, you held elections and all of the old ethnic thugs get into power because they have organization and they have money and they stop the process of genuine building of democracy.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14598</DOCNO>
<TEXT>there is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get legitimate iraqi authority, but the faster you get that, the more likely you stop this process.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14599</DOCNO>
<TEXT>so what do you think of this interim government?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14600</DOCNO>
<TEXT>you got deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz saying that american and british military forces would play a leading role in setting up an iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>14601</DOCNO>
<TEXT>is that going to work?</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>14602</DOCNO>

<TEXT>Bottom line, with less than half of the ground forces and two-thirds of the air assets used 12 years ago in Desert Storm, Secretary Rumsfeld and General Franks have achieved a far more difficult objective.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14864</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Yet until this war is fully won, we cannot be overconfident in our position.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14881</DOCNO>
<TEXT>They are trying to identify Iraqis from within the country, as well as Iraqi dissidents and exiles, the diaspora they call it here at the White House, who will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they say it could takes weeks or more -- of selecting who should be part of that interim Iraqi authority.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14882</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now, we know, one person who will be invited is planning process, those planning meetings, is Ahmed Chalabi.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14883</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He is the leader of the Iraqi National Congress.</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>14885</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He will be involved in the planning and in those meetings.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14886</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I also should report that there is a sense of annoyance here at the White House, even among some of Mr. Chalabi's top supporters, that, since returning to Iraq in recent days, he has complained frequently, including on our air earlier today, that the United States is moving too slowly to get in the reconstruction efforts, to restore electricity and restore water.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14887</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Over at the Pentagon today, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, again, a supporter of Mr. Chalabi, said that, in his view, services were already at their prewar levels.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14888</DOCNO>
<TEXT>And Mr. Rumsfeld went on to say, Secretary Rumsfeld went on to say, there is still a war going on, still quite a dangerous situation -- Judy.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>14908</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14909</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Immediately after she took office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank, zero.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The USCF did not even have the money to pay the guaranteed prizes at the just concluded US Open in Los Angeles.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14911</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14912</DOCNO>
<TEXT>John McCrary resigned from the board as a result.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14913</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14914</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize winners had won at the US Open.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14915</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I have just found out something that insiders had known for a long time.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14916</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The USCF did not have zero money in the bank.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14917</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It had $85,000 in another bank account that nobody knew about.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14918</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This was not due to any malfeasance.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14919</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The office accountant for the USCF had set up a separate bank account and had put the entry fees from the US Open into that account.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14920</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Nobody knew about that separate bank account, except for the accountant herself.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14921</DOCNO>
<TEXT>When this was discovered, the accountant explained that she was planning to keep the money in that account until the tournament was closed out.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14922</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Perhaps the accountant was following a procedure followed by the USCF for scholastic tournaments.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At scholastic tournaments, no cash prizes are paid.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14924</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However, in adult tournaments, the players expect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14925</DOCNO>
<TEXT>For this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF, the accountant was immediately fired.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14926</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known, it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14927</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14954</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It has been suggested that there is, or was at one time, some sort of delegates' motion which established a minimum period between the time someone could leave the EB and the time someone could be hired by the USCF.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14955</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I don't know if this is so, and I really think it's sort of irrelevant.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14956</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's irrelevant because the REAL question is whether an active board member can, while on the board, arrange to be given money by the USCF.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14957</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Of course it's in the bylaws that an active board member cannot be given money by the USCF while on the board.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14958</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14959</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Suppose, for example, there were to be a proposal to the effect that each EB member would be given $10,000 upon the expiration of his/her term.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14960</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Clearly this would be a transparent attempt to evade the bylaws and would fail.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14961</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If the board cannot vote to give themselves present money, they cannot vote to give themselves future money either.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14962</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Furthermore, it doesn't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EB vote or not, or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal EB meeting or not.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14963</DOCNO>
<TEXT>A board member, while on the board, is supposed to be representing the interests of the USCF, not feathering his/her nest, in the present or in the future.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14964</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If a board member makes such arrangements, it is clearly an ethics violation, clearly a violation of the bylaws, possibly endangers our tax-exempt status, and is possibly a violation of law as well.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14965</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The purpose of having a "time limit" would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles; that is, you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition; it would give the voters time to elect a new EB that would consider the issues objectively.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14966</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Of course, it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future, and that then the remaining members could, for good reason, hire that person.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14967</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It would create questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of wrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it wouldn't automatically be an ethics or bylaws violation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14968</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But this is neither here nor there, because the fact that Randy Bauer is already talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF's new "move coordinator", whatever that involves, and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim ED, means that at some level and in some form these discussions HAVE already taken place, while Marinello is serving as President.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14969</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I mean, it's conceivable that the other six have all gotten together in Marinello's absence and drafted her, but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it, and, if all the rumors are true and she steps down, it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14970</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So the 'time limit' issue doesn't even come up.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14971</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We pretty much know that Marinello, while on the board, has arranged to get future money from the USCF.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14972</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So we already have a problem.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14973</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If this is NOT a problem, I wish someone would explain to me why not.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14974</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Now, Stan B. argues that Marinello's services are in fact indispensible as move coordinator, and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact, so that since we absolutely NEED her the EB has the right to go ahead and retain her.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14975</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I agree with the principle.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14976</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But I think that to make this argument work the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really IS indispensible for this task.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14977</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This would have to include evidence that the EB had considered all the alternatives, including:</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14978</DOCNO>
<TEXT>- delegating the whole thing to the Interim ED, which would be the normal practice in normal organizations with an ED</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14979</DOCNO>
<TEXT>- asking the Interim ED to designate someone from the New Windsor staff to act as move coordinator</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14980</DOCNO>
<TEXT>- asking the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job (there are such people)</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14981</DOCNO>
<TEXT>- conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position during the last two months since the move was decided upon</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14982</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If they did consider alternatives, it would also have to include evidence that Marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than other people, or is willing to do the job cheaper (although this wouldn't constitute being "indispensible" in my view).</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14983</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If, however, they just looked around the room and said "who is going to manage this?"</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14984</DOCNO>
<TEXT>and someone said, "Beatriz, how about you?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14985</DOCNO>
<TEXT>", this does not constitute proof that her services are indispensible, and thus it wouldn't interfere with my belief that there has been an ethics violation and a bylaws violation.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14986</DOCNO>
<TEXT>One very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bachler, which to be fair was surrounded by arguably better ones, was that since this board was elected, we should let them do as they please.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14987</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Which is to say that there might as well not be bylaws, ethics standards, laws, etc., since an elected board is not bound by any of them.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14988</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I think this idea should be rejected.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14989</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Another argument, which is better but still disturbing, is that, yes, this is an ethics violation, and maybe worse, but it would only hurt the USCF to talk about it, and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan, Larry Parr, and, I suppose, me, would talk about it, since doing so will obstruct the federation's plans, cause us to pay legal expenses, run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all, cause people not to loan us money, and so forth.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14990</DOCNO>
<TEXT>So we should all ignore this because it is realistic to do so.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14991</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I'm not entirely unsympathetic to this, actually.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14992</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But frankly I think that a whole lot of the problems the USCF has had over the years have had to do with well-intentioned people keeping secrets because bringing them out in the open would harm the USCF, and as a result we have awful habits which hurt the USCF even worse.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14993</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But if we are going to talk about realism, here is another realistic concern: I predict that, if, in fact, the rumors about the agenda for the Florida meeting prove true, and Marinello resigns as President and is hired as move coordinator, the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will file another lawsuit (or amend his current complaint) charging the USCF EB members with self-dealing, violation of the USCF's own bylaws, and every other thing, report us to the IRS, and demand that all USCF moneys which might be used to paid Marinello be frozen.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14994</DOCNO>
<TEXT>This is not based on any communication from Sam, direct or indirect.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14995</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is just logical.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14996</DOCNO>
<TEXT>If he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non-profit organization law, which might or might not be applicable to the USCF, why wouldn't he file a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF's violation of its own bylaws, which unquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14997</DOCNO>
<TEXT>I wrote a few days ago quoting my own employer association's attorney, who said that courts mostly let associations do what they want UNLESS they violate their own bylaws.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>14998</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is irritating enough to get sued by Sam Sloan; imagine how irritating it would be to get sued by Sam Sloan and BEATEN by Sam Sloan because you have done something so egregious that a court is forced to agree with him.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What is the recommended policy on compensating board members for attending meetings, when they have no vacation time left at work, and are attending the board meeting on their own time, without pay.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15003</DOCNO>
<TEXT>We don't want to lose the contributions of this board member, but this has become a financial issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Thanks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If your organization is a charity, it is generally considered to be inappropriate, and in some jurisdictions, it is illegal to compensate board members for their service.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>

<TEXT>You should check out the law in your state and/or country.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Later, "Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more quickly," she writes.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15142</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But responsibility for what?</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15143</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The truth is that, as director of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to authorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15144</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail how, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi Annan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15145</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The informant offered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be used in the genocide campaign.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15146</DOCNO>
<TEXT>All that the informant wanted in return was protection for himself and his family.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15147</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15148</DOCNO>
<TEXT>He asked for that approval but the answer came back in a now-infamous "genocide fax" from Annan's office.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15149</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It denied authorization for the mission and told him that he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness over to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide!</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15150</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The result was that the information dried up and the genocide took place.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15151</DOCNO>

<TEXT>The article ends with the following:</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15158</DOCNO>
<TEXT>In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that the media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it was Mr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office, who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their sympathizers in Rwanda in 1994."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15159</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in the killings.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15160</DOCNO>
<TEXT>But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused to accept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped the killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15161</DOCNO>
<TEXT>It is astonishing that a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan's role.</TEXT>

<TEXT>WASHINGTON, April 28 (AFP) - North Korea has offered to scrap its nuclear weapons and missile programs, but only in return for "considerable" diplomatic, political and economic concessions, the United States said Monday.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15689</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during three-way talks between US, North Korean and Chinese diplomats last week in Beijing.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>15690</DOCNO>
<TEXT>At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons, and threatened to prove it with a "display."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15691</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and, in effect, said that these are now up for further discussion," he told reporters at the State Department.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15692</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their nuclear capability and their missile activities, but they, of course, expect something considerable in return," Powell said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15693</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"We are studying that plan, we are examining it with our friends and allies," Powell said, adding that talks were now underway with the South Korean, Japanese, Russian and Australian as well as other governments.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15694</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go from here," he said, referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in Beijing.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15695</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept the offer, and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms of concesssions.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15696</DOCNO>
<TEXT>However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented a lengthy list of demands.</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>15697</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The demands include full normalization of ties with the United States, security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil and other energy considerations.</TEXT>

<DOCNO>15698</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"They had quite a list of things," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15699</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic assistance, Boucher replied: "I don't really quibble with that characterization of the list."</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>A senior State Department official said later that the list of demands was so extensive that it defied a "concise description."</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although the North Korean demands are being looked at, Boucher repeated long-standing US policy that Washington would not be blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying Pyongyang off.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15703</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"We've made clear we're not going to pay for elimination of the nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first place," he said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15704</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove it possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the Beijing talks, but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the words "test" or "testing."</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15705</DOCNO>
<TEXT>"They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in one way or another," he said.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a "bold" proposal for addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula that North Korea presented in Beijing, officials said.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides, stressing that Washington would not consider such moves until the "verifiable and irreversible termination" of the north's nuclear programs.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15709</DOCNO>

<TEXT>MCI to pay huge fine to SEC for accounting fraud: report</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>15814</DOCNO>
<TEXT>MCI, formerly WorldCom, and the Securities and Exchange Commission have reached a final agreement in the telecom giant's 11-billion-dollar (9.4-billion-euro) fraud case, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15815</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Under terms of the agreement, to be submitted as early as Monday to a judge presiding over the case, MCI would agree to pay the largest fine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not a broker-dealer, the Journal said, citing sources close to the matter.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15816</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The report did not give the amount of the fine, but said it would be "exponentially larger" than the historic 10 million dollars Xerox paid the SEC last year.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15817</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Last month, the SEC slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10 Wall Street brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interest between analysts and investors.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15818</DOCNO>
<TEXT>MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partial settlement in November under which MCI, formerly known as WorldCom, agreed not to mislead investors about its finances, and to improve internal controls, the Journal said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15819</DOCNO>
<TEXT>The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions, swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11 million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on, the report said.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15820</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Separately, former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 to make a first repayment of 25 million dollars, plus interest, on a 400-million-dollar loan from MCI, the Journal said, citing SEC documents.</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>15821</DOCNO>
<TEXT>Because he is now in default MCI must now seize additional assets owned by Ebbers, to secure the loan.</TEXT>
