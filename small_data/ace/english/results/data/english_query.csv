1919	Conflict:Attack	1510	I think that it was a front -- for him to allow to to be accepted in an international community, but I think -- that his ultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closer to the Gaza strip, and to re-take Jerusalem -- and other cities near Jerusalem,  and to, uh, uplift his people in a way that -- they could say, you know, we conquered the Israelis.	conquered	78	79

1926	Conflict:Attack	1510	And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the United States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a nicer way.	conflict	28	29
1927	Conflict:Attack	1510	Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were saying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that it probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry would do the best he could.	attack	21	22
